<p>What most struck me, though, was that it was also such a great experience on the human, not coding, side of things. With a manageable number of people present, you could really get to know each and every one (plus, in various cases, their loved ones, both tall &amp; tiny… #goplonegoplone). </p>
<p>This was reflected in the sprinting as well; no sooner had two highly interesting talks on <a href="http://cosent.nl/en/blog/plonesocial-plog2013" target="_blank">social</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ThomasDesvenain/collectivelocal-plog2013-v2" target="_blank">workspaces</a> finished, or the authors got together to see if they could combine their work to make for some truly interactive intranet-behaviors.</p>
<p>The pattern (no pun intented) continued: people were not just developing their own pet projects, but talking to each other to get stuff moving. One example: After @datakurre had <a href="http://datakurre.pandala.org/2013/04/generate-annotated-screenshots-with.html" target="_blank">proven</a> he will soon bring about the Robocalypse, when Plone will become self-aware and start to talk to unsuspecting users, he also worked on a proof-of-concept to integrate accessibility testing. <br/>A few days later, we’re still clearing up some licensing issues, but we will very soon have basic a11y testing into the Plone automated testing stack. This is a <strong><em>huge</em></strong> win, especially with things moving forward so fast in the UI department.</p>
<p>Pool Driven Development also was a keeper. Write documentation, or be thrown in a rather chilly pool. Works a treat!</p>
<p>Other highlights for me were a special session with ‘rookies’. A great, hands-on way to ask where new people get stuck, help get them un-stuck on the spot, and engage them in improving the experience for other newcomers. This <em>definitely</em> should be repeated at other Plone events.</p>
<p>As should be the 'strategic discussion’. It was late at night, it was unstructured, but with 10+ people present with a wealth of Plone experience it was also very valuable. This one deserves a separate write-up, which I will try to do a bit later.</p>
<p>Hidden gem: Netsights’ plugin for Single Sign on, cunningly named <a href="https://github.com/netsight/netsight.windowsauthplugin" target="_blank">windowsauthplugin</a>. Now of course, this is just a little white lie; there is nothing Windows-specific about it, and it will work just as well if you have a Kerberized NFS-4 setup. But let’s not tell the Windows people that the <em>working</em> part of their AD setups is based on tested Unix technology, now shall we…<br/>In any case, this means we can do more than ever to save the world, and countless unhappy users, from the hell that is Sharepoint and bring them some Plone goodness.</p>

<p>Much more went on, but these were the highlights for me. Oh, and that Negroni in the harbour of Sorrento, obviously.</p>
<p>So, next year again? You bet!</p></div></summary><updated planet:format="April 16, 2013 09:41 AM">2013-04-16T09:41:24Z</updated><category term="plone"/><source><id>http://polyrambling.tumblr.com/</id><author><name>Paul Roeland</name></author><link href="http://polyrambling.tumblr.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://polyrambling.tumblr.com/rss" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><subtitle>On opensource, cocktails and other stuff I like</subtitle><title>Polyester's ramblings</title><updated planet:format="December 26, 2015 10:40 AM">2015-12-26T10:40:12Z</updated><planet:format>rss20</planet:format><planet:faceheight>85</planet:faceheight><planet:facewidth>85</planet:facewidth><planet:face>polyester.png</planet:face><planet:items_per_page>60</planet:items_per_page><planet:name>Paul Roeland</planet:name><planet:css-id>paul-roeland</planet:css-id><planet:nick>polyester</planet:nick><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo></source></entry>
