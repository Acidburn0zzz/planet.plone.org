(Yes, the website is in Dutch, our curious grunting language, but it’s applicable to more…)</p>
<p>We started out with an old, crappy, user-hostile website. It was based on Joomla, customized to death, not upgradeable, and even posting a simple news item cost half an hour.</p>
<p>The choice for Plone was an easy one, as our intranet runs on it, and we have experience with it.</p>
<p><strong>Getting old content out</strong></p>
<p>transmogrifier to the rescue! We had about 1100 old articles, which we needed to save, if only to condense them into overviews. </p>
<p>Now beware, transmogrifier is not for the faint-of-heart. It’s a powertool, with fast-moving sharp blades. You don’t need much knowledge of Plone, but a lot of generic sysadmin knowledge to make it work, and usually some dabbling in SQL. I’m a sysadmin so managed fine, but most nonprofits don’t have one. If you can, outsource this to your local friendly service provider.</p>
<p><strong>Plone products used</strong></p>
<p>The new site runs Plone 4.2, and the following add-ons. Quite a lot, but most of them are sort of necessary…</p>
<ul><li>diazo. In our case, coupled with diazotheme.bootstrap. Yep, that’s twitter’s bootstrap, which does all kinds of dark css magic to keep it responsive and mostly working on IE. I don’t know a lot about CSS, so gladly tagged along with current best practice. It also leverages webcouturier.dropdownmenu</li>
<li>the usuals: PloneFormGen, collective.quickupload, wc.pageturner, collective.embedly to take the pain out of embedding media, and various fun portlets. Oh, and Doormat, obviously.</li>
<li>collective.easyslider. Great fun, and just needs some extra CSS which even I can provide to do fancy overlays for the front page.</li>
<li>ContentWellPortlets. Yes, Deco is just round the corner, but we needed a solution right now. And it does uninstall cleanly, so when Deco is around we can move on.</li>
<li>collective.megaphone for petitions.</li>
<li>pcommerce for our little webshop. For a small shop, this is all you need.</li>
<li>the brilliant eea.* set of products. eea.tags for sane tags, eea.facetednavigation for a nice interface to loads of docs.</li>
<li>icing on the cake: unweb.iptc to automagically extract tags from photos, collective.routes to do cool stuff with URL’s.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Pet peeves remaining:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Having to use collective.contentleadimage in this day and age is just a shame. It works, and works great. It is also needed. Try explaining to editors that NewsItems can have an image that shows up in content listings, but Pages can’t. You can’t and you shouldn’t have to. <br/>But there are inconsistencies with setting image sizes with the regular NewsItem. And customizing the NewsItem views is a royal pain in the lower backside. <br/>Really, ContentLeadImage functionality should so go into core. Like yesterday.</li>
<li>There is some confusion between new and old style Collections. Not all add-ons can use the new ones, and having both enabled confuses the editors. So down to the old ones for now. Hoping this will pass with time.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Big wins:</strong></p>
<ul><li>happy editors. Like, very happy editors. They now can update the site completely without technical assistance. This is a big win. A huge win. It means we can get back to our job, which is improving the lives of underpaid garment workers around the world. Not struggling with a CMS.</li>
<li>happy supporters. They like our site. A lot.</li>
</ul><p>So, all in all, a succesful project, run on a budget of (ahum) 0 euros. </p>
<p><strong>Would I recommend this to other nonprofits? </strong></p>
<p>Well, first fight for more budget. You’ll get it done sooner, and better, with your local trusted Plone service provider. Doing the import of old content is definitely something you’re better off outsourcing.</p>
<p>But if push comes to shove, and you’re faced with the choice of having to stick with inferior CMS’s or move to Plone, it can be done on a budget.</p>
<p>Make sure your webteam collects all the happy reactions from users and editors, and use that as ammo to get more budget next year. Then you can hire more professional help, and get to do the fun stuff yourself. Like save the world. And the cheerleader (M/F).</p></div></summary><updated planet:format="August 31, 2012 07:13 PM">2012-08-31T19:13:00Z</updated><source><id>http://polyrambling.tumblr.com/</id><author><name>Paul Roeland</name></author><link href="http://polyrambling.tumblr.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://polyrambling.tumblr.com/rss" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><subtitle>On opensource, cocktails and other stuff I like</subtitle><title>Polyester's ramblings</title><updated planet:format="December 26, 2015 10:40 AM">2015-12-26T10:40:12Z</updated><planet:format>rss20</planet:format><planet:faceheight>85</planet:faceheight><planet:facewidth>85</planet:facewidth><planet:face>polyester.png</planet:face><planet:items_per_page>60</planet:items_per_page><planet:name>Paul Roeland</planet:name><planet:css-id>paul-roeland</planet:css-id><planet:nick>polyester</planet:nick><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo></source></entry>
