<h4><a href="https://www.fourdigits.nl/blog/django-under-the-hood">Django Under The Hood</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Bijgewerkt: zaterdag 20:00</p>
<p>De donderdag begon met een presentatie van Jacob Kaplan-Moss over HTTP. Hoe gaat Django om met een HTTP-request? Hoe rolt daar een response uit? Hij gaf diverse plekken aan waar een ontwikkelaar voor een klant-applicatie kan "inprikken" op de bestaande Django-techniek. In het voorbijgaan schetste hij ook de ontwikkeling van de techniek; de keuzes die daarin gemaakt zijn en hoe die uitgepakt zijn. Een interessante talk van iemand zowel in techniek als in presentatie goed thuis is.</p>
<p>Vervolgens sprak Ola Sitarska over Django's admin-interface. Zij gaf aan hoe je deze naar je hand kunt zetten en wat de diverse plekken zijn om dit het handigst te doen.</p>
<p>Als laatste sprak Iacopo Spalletti over DjangoCMS, een content management-systeem gebouwd op Django. Hij besprak de designkeuzes die zijn gemaakt, vooral met betrekking tot het installeren van plugins. </p>
<p>Vrijdag begon met een goede kop filterkoffie en een keynote van Russell Keith-Magee, een van de de actievere ontwikkelaars van de laatste tijd. Aan de hand van Django's commit messages vanaf het eerste uur gaf hij commentaar bij de ontwikkeling. Een centrale vraag was hoe je een groeiende community gezond houdt. Aan de hand van de verhalen bij de commits kon Russell met veel humor hierover vertellen.</p>
<p>De volgende presentatie ging over "expressions". Dit is een manier om ingewikkelde queries op de database te doen. Josh Smeaton is een SQL-expert die relatief nieuw is in Django. Hij legde uit hoe je met F()-expressions dingen kunt doen die tot dusverre vaak werden opgelost met minder robuuste (bijvoorbeeld database-specifieke) technieken. Deze en andere expressions worden uitgelegd op <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/expressions/" target="_self" title="Django Expressions reference">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/expressions/</a> De implementatie is in Django 1.8 ingrijpend aangepast en daardoor sneller gemaakt, met dank aan Josh.</p>
<p>Amber Brown sprak over Twisted en Django. Dit is een mogelijkheid om asynchrone operaties makkelijker te maken in Django. Ze schetste een simpele patch in DJango die dit mogelijk maakt, waardoor onder andere een veel hogere performance mogelijk wordt. Haar presentatie staat op </p>

<p>James Aylett vertelde over static files. Het ging dan vooral over CSS en Javascript. Vele soorten pipelines kwamen aan bod. Node.js is hier leidend in, er zijn verschillende oplossingen mogelijk. Django moet daar geen keuze in maken, omdat het veld sterk verandert. Zijn voorstel is de staticfiles-module te promoveren tot een core-module.</p>
<p>Django security was een presentatie met diverse beveiligingstips voor Django-programmeurs. Florian Apolloner raadde ons aan vooral mark_safe(json.dumps()) te gebruiken.</p>
<p>De laatste presentatie van de dag was Documentation systems van Eric Holscher. Hij legde het hoe en waarom uit van <a class="external-link" href="https://readthedocs.org/" target="_self" title="Read The Docs">https://readthedocs.org/</a>. Dit leunt op het gebruik van Sphinx. Semantische markup (RST) is beter is dan markdown. Hij vertelde hoe je het kunt integreren met je code-module, zonder je zorgen te hoeven maken over de weergave.</p>
<p>'s Avonds was er een feest voor alle conferentiegangers. Tijdens dit feest werden er door diverse sprekers lightning talks gepresenteerd.</p>
<p>Zaterdag waren er ongeveer 120 mensen verzameld in het kantoor van <a class="external-link" href="http://travelbird.nl/" target="_self" title="Website TravelBird">TravelBird</a>, dat haar ruimte, bureaus en schermen ter beschikking stelde voor de sprint. Er werd gewerkt aan diverse onderwerpen: de admin-interface, het static files-verhaal, expressions, en andere thema's van de lezingen kwamen terug. Er waren workshops over documentatie schrijven en deployment op Heroku. Ikzelf heb me bezig gehouden met openstaande issues in Wagtail. De oorspronkelijke bedenker van Wagtail, Matt Westcott, was ook aanwezig dus dat maakte het overleg makkelijk.</p>
<p>Al met al een goed georganiseerde en technisch waardevolle conferentie. </p>
<p>Dit was de conferentie live op Twitter:<br /><a class="external-link" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/djangounderthehood" target="_self" title="Twitter hashtag djangounderthehood">https://twitter.com/hashtag/djangounderthehood</a><br /><a class="external-link" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/duth" target="_self" title="Twitter hashtag duth">https://twitter.com/hashtag/duth</a></p></div>

<h4 lang="en"><a href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/javascript-dependencies-revisited-an-example-project.html">JavaScript Dependencies Revisited: An Example Project</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div><div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A few years ago I wrote an <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/overwhelmed-by-javascript-dependencies.html">article on how I was overwhelmed by
JavaScript dependencies</a>. In it I explored the difficulty of managing
dependencies in a JavaScript project: both internal modules as well as
depending on external packages. There were a ton of options available,
and none of them seemed to entirely fit what I wanted. I <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/js-dependency-tools-redux.html">followed up
on it</a> going into the problem in more depth. Typical for JavaScript
there were a <em>lot</em> of different solutions for this problem.</p>
<p>The article on how I was overwhelmed is consistently one of the most
read articles on this blog, even though the overwhelming majority of
posts over the years is actually on Python. Apparently a lot of people
are overwhelmed by JavaScript dependency management.</p>
<p>It's time for an update. A few years in JavaScript time is like 10
years in normal years, anyway. Everything changed like five times over
since then.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-changed-in-javascript">
<h2>What changed in JavaScript</h2>
<p>So let's go through some of the changes:</p>
<p>One of the most important changes is that JavaScript now has a
standard way to do imports in the ES6 version of the language, and
that people are using it in practice, through transpilers like Babel.</p>
<p>Another change is that using npm and CommonJS packages has been
emerging as the most popular way to do client-side dependency
management, after being the dominant tool on the server already. In
fact, back in 2013 people were already suggesting I use npm and a
bundling tool (like Browserify), and I was resistant then. But they
were right. In any case, it was already clear then that CommonJS was
one of the most structured ways to do dependencies, and it's therefore
no surprise this lead to a great tooling ecosystem.</p>
<p>Source map support in browsers has also matured. One of the reasons I
was resistant to a compile-time step is that debugging using the
browser introspector becomes more difficult. Now that source maps are
pretty well established, that is less of a problem. It's still not as
good as debugging code that doesn't need a compilation step, but it's
tolerable.</p>
<p>While I'd like to be able to do without a compilation step, I need
performance, until the adoption of HTTP 2 makes this less of a
concern. I want to use ES6 and JSX anyway, so some kind of compilation
step cannot be avoided anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-bundling-example">
<h2>A Bundling Example</h2>
<p>Last week I talked to Timo Stollenwerk about bundling tools. He asked
me to put a little example project together. So I created one: it does
bundling through Webpack, lets you use modern ES6 JavaScript through
Babel and has eslint support.</p>
<p>There are a ton of example JavaScript projects out there already. A
lot of them have quite a bit of JavaScript code in them to drive tools
like gulp or grunt -- something I don't really like. I prefer
declarative configuration and reusable libraries, not custom
JavaScript code I need to copy into my project. These projects also
tend to have quite a bit of code and little documentation that tells
you what's going on.</p>
<p>While creating my example project, I went a bit overboard on the
README. So this example is the opposite of many others: a lot of
documentation and very little code. In the README, I go step by step
explaining how to set up a modern client-side JavaScript development
environment.</p>
<p>The choices of tools in the project are my own -- they're stuff that
I've found works well together and is simple enough for me to
understand. Many alternatives are possible.</p>
<p>I hope it is of help to anyone! Enjoy!</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.fourdigits.nl/blog/ploneconf-2015">PloneConf 2015</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Met vier man bezochten we de conferentie. Thijs en Ludolf volgden maandag en dinsdag een training, om op de hoogte te zijn van de nieuwste technieken in Plone.</p>
<p><img alt="Een lightning talk" class="image-right" src="https://www.fourdigits.nl/images/DSC_0061.JPG" title="Een lightning talk" /></p>
<div>
<div>
<p>De conferentie stond voornamelijk in het teken van de voornaamste ontwikkeling van dit jaar: de release van Plone 5. Vanaf de keynote-presentatie was al duidelijk dat een grote mijlpaal is: sneller, mooier, sterker.</p>
<p>Ook gelanceerd is Plone Intranet. Dit is een sociaal intranet met vele eigenschappen die in het moderne samenwerken nodig zijn. Het is ontwikkeld door samenwerkende Europese Plone-partijen en munt uit door een uitermate doordachte gebruikerservaring. Hiermee heeft Plone nu een zeer concurrerend, off-the-shelf intranet-product in huis.</p>
<p>Dit jaar is <a class="external-link" href="http://plone.com" target="_self" title="">plone.com</a> gelanceerd, ons visitekaartje naar het bedrijfsleven. Het doel is Plone op professionele wijze te presenteren aan beslissers. De "oude" site <a class="external-link" href="http://plone.org" target="_self" title="">plone.org</a> blijft dienst doen als portaal voor ontwikkelaars.</p>
<p>Hoe divers Plone is werd duidelijk door de over uiteenlopende onderwerpen van de presentaties: van media-publishing tot urenregistratiesysteem, Plone wordt op allerlei manieren ingezet. Een praatje als "Hoe houden we Plone veilig, maar toch ook flexibel" sprak dan ook veel mensen aan.</p>
<p>Er werd gediscussiëerd over diverse onderwerpen, zoals bijvoorbeeld "waar willen we staan over vijf jaar". Dit werd gestructureerd in zogenaamde "open spaces" waar iedereen mag aanschuiven: de Plone-community vergadert niet achter gesloten deuren.</p>
<p>Daarnaast presenteerden diverse ontwikkelaars handige technieken en wisselden ervaringen uit. De discussies gingen vaak buiten kantooruren verder.</p>
<p>Vrijdag werd afgesloten met de plenaire vergadering van de Plone Foundation. Deze stichting beheert en beschermt het merk Plone, zodat het product Plone niet afhankelijk is van één bedrijf. Tijdens de vergadering werd het nieuwe bestuur voor het komende jaar gekozen.</p>
<p>De laatste twee dagen werd er "gesprint": Degenen die dit wilden verdeelden zich over diverse teams om gericht aan een bepaalde taak te werken. Zo is zaterdag de documentatie van Plone 5 verbeterd, is er gewerkt aan de vernieuwing van site plone.org en is er een upgrade-handleiding om extra plug-ins geschikt te maken voor Plone 5.</p>
<p>We kijken terug op een mooie conferentie, en we kijken uit op een zonnige toekomst voor Plone.</p>

<h4 lang="en"><a href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/the-incredible-drifting-cyber.html">The Incredible Drifting Cyber</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div><div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It's been interesting how the prefix <em>cyber</em> has drifted in meaning
over the years. Let's explore together.</p>
<p>I wrote two thirds of this article and then I discovered Annalee
Newitz was way ahead of me and <a class="reference external" href="http://io9.com/today-cyber-means-war-but-back-in-the-1990s-it-mean-1325671487">wrote about the same thing two years
ago</a>. Since my article has different details I decided to finish it
and put it on my blog after all. There's plenty of room in
cyberspace. But read Annalee Newitz's article too!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ancient-times">
<h2>Ancient Times: κυβερνητική</h2>
<p>The ancient Greeks had a bunch of "kybern-" words. κυβερνάω (kybernao)
means "to steer", and the Greek words for ship's captain and
government are related. κυβερνητική (kybernetike) was used by Plato to
mean governance of people.</p>
<p>So kybern- stuff was about steering and governance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cybernetics">
<h2>Cybernetics</h2>
<p>In 1948 Norbert Wiener coined the word "cybernetics" in English based
on the Greek word κυβερνητική. Wiener was a mathematician who worked
on the automatic aiming of anti-aircraft guns during World War
II. Wiener started to think about the general principles of control
systems. I appreciate how he extracted some good from thoughts about guns.</p>
<p>A very simple control system most people are familiar with is a
thermostat: when the temperature falls below a certain set value, it
turns on a heater until the temperature is back at the required value
again. We find many more complex control processes in living
organisms: such blood sugar regulation as body temperature regulation.</p>
<p>Wiener called the study of control systems cybernetics, and
investigated general principles behind control systems in a lot of
different areas: from electronics to biology to psychology. He foresaw
a lot of later developments in computer technology. Interdisciplinary
thought like this can be very fruitful.</p>
<p>Wiener's work on cybernetics was quite inspirational in a range of
fields, causing the meaning of the word "cybernetics" to become as
stretched as "chaos theory" was for a while in the 1990s. Such is the
risk of interdisciplinary studies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cyborg">
<h2>Cyborg</h2>
<p>At first we didn't have the <em>cyber</em> prefix. We just had <em>cyb</em>.</p>
<p>We move into the space age. In 1960, two researchers, Manfred Clynes
and Nathan Kline, also known as the Klynes (okay I just made that up),
published an <a class="reference external" href="http://web.mit.edu/digitalapollo/Documents/Chapter1/cyborgs.pdf">article</a> about the idea of adapting human bodies with
cybernetic technology to make them more suitable for the environment
of space. With the right combination of drugs and machinery we could
adjust humans so they can deal with long duration space voyages. They
named the resulting combined cybernetic organism a "cyborg".</p>
<p>They realized that such a cyborg might go mad floating in the vastness
of space:</p>
<blockquote>
Despite all the care exercised, there remains a strong possibility
that somewhere in the course of a long space voyage a psychotic
episode might occur, and this is one condition for which no
servomechanism can be completely designed at the present time.</blockquote>
<p>Since the cyborg might refuse to take medication voluntarily, they can
still pump them full of drugs remotely:</p>
<blockquote>
For this reason, if monitoring is adequate, provision should be made
for triggering administration of the medication remotely from
earth or by a companion if there is a crew on the vehicle.</blockquote>
<p>It sure was a document of its time, including "space race" reference
to possible competing Soviet research into the cyborg topic. Oh no,
they might be ahead of us! The article concluded that:</p>
<blockquote>
Solving the many technological problems involved in manned space
flight by adapting man to his environment, rather than vice versa,
will not only mark a significant step forward in man's scientific
progress, but may well provide a new and larger dimension for
man's spirit as well.</blockquote>
<p>Today we see many examples of what could be described as "cyborg"
technology, though we aren't taking it as quite far as these researchers
imagined yet. <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Six_Million_Dollar_Man">We don't have the technology</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cyber-in-science-fiction">
<h2>Cyber in Science Fiction</h2>
<p>The idea of the the human/machine hybrid predates World War II in
science fiction, but these researchers gave it a name that stuck.</p>
<p>This is where the <em>cyber</em> prefix starts entering pop culture. Doctor
Who in 1966 introduced the Cybermen, biological organisms that have
replaced most of their bodies with cybernetic parts. They're cyborgs,
and nasty ones: they proceed to forcibly convert victims into more
Cybermen. In the 1980s a similar concept was introduced into Star Trek
as the Borg. Just as Star Wars turned the older word "Android" into
"Droid", Star Trek turned "Cyborg" into "Borg".</p>
<p>So <em>cyber</em> is about cybernetic organisms. Not all of it though:
Cybernetics crosses into many disciplines, so it was easy for <em>cyber</em>
to become associated with computers and robots as well: Cybertron is
the home world of giant robots that can transform into stuff. It
involves <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF5tiMXUpQ0">lots of explosions</a> somehow. Or Cyberdyne systems, who
create Skynet. It creates a Governator (government again!) that is
sent back in time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cyberpunk-and-cyberspace">
<h2>Cyberpunk and Cyberspace</h2>
<p>But we're getting ahead of ourselves. In the early 1980s, the prefix
<em>cyber</em> appears in a new subgenre in science fiction,
<em>Cyberpunk</em>. Gone are the gleaming towers, the distant worlds and
silver bodysuits of earlier science fiction imagery. Cyberpunk is
"high tech and low life" -- the radical collision of high technology
with the street. We know this today as <em>today</em>, though we're a lot
less cool with our smartphones than the mirror-shaded cyber-implanted
street toughs envisioned by Cyberpunk fiction.</p>
<p>The seminal work of Cyberpunk fiction is <em>Neuromancer</em> by William
Gibson, from 1984. In it Gibson coins the word <em>Cyberspace</em>, which
doesn't have boring HTML but instead uses virtual reality to navigate
data, as that's just so much cooler.</p>
<p><em>Cyber</em> was now associated with digital spaces. The Internet was
coming. Now the floodgates are open and we're ready for the 1990s.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="riding-the-1990s-cyber-highway">
<h2>Riding the 1990s Cyber Highway</h2>
<p>The Internet has a longer history, but it really speeds into popular
consciousness in the early 1990s. One day it's all boring computer
stuff nobody cares about except a few geeks like me, the next day you
hear people exchange their email address in the bus. Journalists and
academics, never afraid to write articles about neat new stuff they
can play around with at work (and why not?)  produce massive
quantities of new words with the prefix <em>cyber</em>. <em>Cyber</em> is <em>cool</em>.</p>
<p>The Internet is bright and new. Nobody has heard of spam yet, and
email viruses are still a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cityscope.net/hoax1.html">hoax</a>.</p>
<p>So we are homesteading the cyberfrontier, found new
cybercorporations. Are we building a cyberutopia or a cyberghetto with
a cyberelite? Will we one day all ascend into cyberimmortality?</p>
<p>You see where this is going. By 1999 people are calling the prefix
"terminally overused". <em>Cyber</em> is now uncool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="to-cyber">
<h2>To Cyber</h2>
<p>The <em>cyber</em> prefix then takes a surprising turn and turns into a
full-fledged word all by itself! In the late 1990s <em>cyber</em> becomes a
verb: to have cybersex in online chat. "Wanna cyber?" Words like
"cyberutopia" and "cyberelite" can now elicit a snicker.</p>
<p>It was not to last, though we should still pretend it is, as <em>cyber</em>
is about to take a dark turn.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cyber-turns-dark">
<h2>Cyber Turns Dark</h2>
<p>Apparently blissfully unaware of the naughty meaning of the word, the
<em>cyber</em> prefix has in recent years become re-purposed by serious
people for <em>bad</em> stuff that happens online: cybercrime, cyberbullying,
cybersecurity, cyberwar. Or maybe it is the other way around, and only
with enough distance from fun naughty things can the prefix <em>cyber</em>
still hold a useful meaning, and it's such an unfun word now exactly
<em>because</em> there was an association with naughty stuff previously.</p>
<p>And after all, we've associated dehumanizing technology with bad stuff
in science fiction since at least Frankenstein's Monster, and the
prefix <em>cyber</em> has been used in that context for years. Cybermen are
still bad guys.</p>
<p>This is a dark turn for <em>cyber</em>. I don't like living in a world of
cybersecurity. I imagine at a cybersecurity conference overly serious
people discuss about how to take more privacy away from citizens, in
the shadow of ominous threats they don't quite understand. Unless they
are busting into hotel rooms while you're nude. (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/04/20/gccs_2015_roundup/?page=1">really</a>. In my own
country, no less!)</p>
<p>Will the word <em>cyber</em> remain dark now that the dour people have
clenched their fists around it? The word has been versatile so far,
but I'm not optimistic. In any case we do need to get some of that
1990s cyberspirit back, and then we can perhaps, again, work on that
1960s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tasteofcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2001-A-Space-Odyssey.jpg">new and larger dimension</a> for the human spirit. Or at least have
fun.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rackt/reselect">Reselect</a> is a library with a very brief history that until a few days
ago was sitting on my personal Github account. What does it do? It's
not very relevant for this blog post, as I'm more interested in its
history as an open source project. But briefly: it's a JavaScript
library. It lets you automatically cache expensive calculations in a
client-side web application.</p>
<p>Reselect was born in early July of this year. Since then, in less than
four months, it gained more than 700 stars on Github. To compare: I
have another project that I spent a few years working on and
promoting. I blogged about it, spoke about it at two conferences, and
at a meetup or two. It has less than 200 stars.</p>
<p>So I thought it might be instructive and amusing to trace the brief
history of this little library.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="context-javascript">
<h2>Context: JavaScript</h2>
<p>Reselect is a JavaScript library. JavaScript has been a very fast
moving space these last few years. The JavaScript community moves so
quickly people make jokes about it: new JavaScript MVC frameworks get
invented every day. I actually created my own way back before it was
cool; I'm a JavaScript MVC framework hipster.</p>
<p>Tooling for both client and server JavaScript changes very quickly. In
the last year have we seen the emergence of ES6, also known as ES2015,
which only got formally ratified as a standard last June. It's a huge
update to the JavaScript language.</p>
<p>JavaScript is in the interesting position of being a lingua franca:
it's a language <em>many</em> developers learn, coming from a wide range of
different programming communities. Ideas and values from these
different programming communities get adopted into JavaScript. One of
the most interesting results of this has been the adoption of
functional programming techniques into JavaScript.</p>
<p>I actually find myself learning about more advanced functional
programming techniques now because I am writing a front-end web
application. This is cool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="context-react">
<h2>Context: React</h2>
<p>React is a JavaScript library that came out of Facebook. It lets you
build rich client-side web applications. It's good at doing UI
stuff. I like it.</p>
<p>The React community is very creative. React rethought how client-side
UIs works, and now people are rethinking all kinds of stuff. Some of
these new thoughts will turn out to be bad ones. That's normal for
creativity. We're learning stuff.</p>
<p>When you have a UI you have to manage the UI state: UI state has to be
kept in sync with state on the server somehow. A UI may need to be
updated in several places at once.</p>
<p>Last year Facebook presented this new way to managestate they called
Flux. It's inspired by some functional programming
ideas. Interestingly enough they didn't release code at first, just
talked about the basic idea. As a result in typical JavaScript fashion
a thousand Flux implementations bloomed.</p>
<p>Then in May of this year, Dan Abramov announced on Twitter "Oh no am I
really writing my own Flux library".</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Oh no am I really writing my own Flux library</p>— Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/604356871722569728">May 29, 2015</a></blockquote></div>
<div class="section" id="context-redux">
<h2>Context: Redux</h2>
<p>A few words about Dan Abramov. He's smart. He's creative. He's
approachable. He's intimidatingly good at open source, even though
he's been around for only a short time. He connected to everybody on
Twitter, spreading knowledge around. He built very useful libraries.</p>
<p>So in a few short months, at typical JavaScript speed, Redux turned
from "yet another Flux library" to what's probably the most popular
Flux implementation around today. Dan rethought the way Flux should
work, applied some more functional programming concepts, created
awesome tooling, and people liked it.</p>
<p>I give it away early, but the rise of Redux explains why Reselect
became so popular so quickly: it's riding the coattails of Redux. Dan
Abramov promoted it with his Twitter megaphone, and included a
reference to it in the Redux documentation as a way to solve a
particular class of performance problems.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Reselect lets you compose nested state selectors with memoization a la NuclearJS: <a href="https://t.co/d5uFyxDjI9">https://t.co/d5uFyxDjI9</a> <a href="http://t.co/Qiv6YLrxV8">pic.twitter.com/Qiv6YLrxV8</a></p>— Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/619531111996223488">July 10, 2015</a></blockquote></div>
<div class="section" id="reselect-prehistory">
<h2>Reselect prehistory</h2>
<p>So how did Reselect come about?</p>
<p>In early June, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rackt/redux/issues/47">the problem was identified</a> in the Redux issue tracker.</p>
<p>In late June Robbert Binna came out with a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rackt/redux/pull/169">pull request</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-birth-of-reselect">
<h2>The birth of Reselect</h2>
<p>In the beginning of July, the first React Europe conference was held
in Paris. I had signed up to the Hackathon to be held one day before
the conference. I was almost more excited about this than the
conference itself, because I have very good experiences with
collaborative software development meetups. You can really get to know
other developers, learn a lot, and build cool new open source
infrastructure stuff. It lets you get out of the details of your day
to day project and step back and solve deeper problems in a good way.</p>
<p>But a few days before my departure I learned to my dismay that this
Hackathon was supposed to be a contest for a prize, not a collaborative
hacking session. I grumbled about this on the Redux chat channel. I asked
whether anyone was interested in hacking on infrastructure stuff instead.</p>
<p>Luckily Lee Bannard (AKA <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ellbee">ellbee</a>) replied and said he was! So we
arranged to meet up.</p>
<p>So on the day of the Hackathon the two of us sat outside of the main
room where everybody was focused on the contest. Lee had the idea to
work on this calculation caching issue. I was a complete noob about
this particular problem, so he explained it to me. He had experience
with how NuclearJS tackled the problem, and knew about the pull
request for Redux.</p>
<p>We also met Dan Abramov there, so we could talk to him directly. He
was reluctant to add new facilities to Redux itself, especially as we
were still exploring the problem space. So we decided to create a new
library for it that could be used with Redux: Reselect.</p>
<p>We sat down and carefully examined the pull request. At first I was
"this is all wrong" but the longer we looked I realized the code was
actually quite right and I was wrong: it was elegant, doing what was
needed in a few lines of code.</p>
<p>We refactored the code a little, making it more generic. We cleaned up
the API a bit. We also added automated tests. Along the way we needed
to check it in somewhere so I put it on my personal Github page. At
the end of the day we had a pretty nice little library.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the conference a lot, went home and wrote a <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/thoughts-about-react-europe.html">report</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reselect-afterwards">
<h2>Reselect afterwards</h2>
<p>I got busy with work. While I glanced at Reselect once every while I
had no immediate use for it in my project. I quickly gave Lee full
access to the project so I wasn't going to block anything. Lee Bannard
proved a very capable maintainer. He also added a lot of
documentation. Dan used his megaphone, and Reselect got quite a few
users quickly, and a lot of small contributions. The official Redux
documentation points to Reselect.</p>
<p>And as my work project progressed, I found out I did have a use case
for it after all, and started using it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-did-not-create-reselect">
<h2>I did not create Reselect</h2>
<p>Since it was on my Github account, people naturally associated me with
the project, and assumed it was mine. While that's very good for my
name recognition, it didn't sit right with me. I spent a day helping
it into existence, and a few hours more afterwards, but more credit
should go to others. It's very much a collaborative project.</p>
<p>I brought this up with Lee a few times. He insisted repeatedly he did
not mind it being on my Github account at all. Now I think he's
awesome!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">To build reselect was <a href="https://twitter.com/leebannard">@leebannard</a>'s idea. It was based on a proposal by speedskater. Me, I helped out a bit. :)</p>— Martijn Faassen (@faassen) <a href="https://twitter.com/faassen/status/652132110124322816">October 8, 2015</a></blockquote></div>
<div class="section" id="to-rackt">
<h2>To Rackt</h2>
<p>But last week, as people told me explicitly "hey, I use your Reselect
library!" I figured I should do something about it. Redux had already
moved into the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rackt/">Rackt</a> project to make it a true community
project. Rackt is a kind of curated collection of React libraries, and
a community group that maintains them. Technically there is not much
difference to hosting the project on my Github account, but such
details do matter: if you want community contributions in an open
source project, it helps to show that it's a genuine community
project.</p>
<p>So I <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rackt/reselect/issues/51">proposed</a> we should move Reselect too, and people agreed it would
be a good idea. It turned out the Rackt folks were happy to accept
Reselect, so a few Tweets later the deed was done and Reselect now
lives in its new home.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Very happy to have the reselect team join rackt! <a href="https://t.co/HW3rtxBvW7">https://t.co/HW3rtxBvW7</a> Welcome <a href="https://twitter.com/faassen">@faassen</a> and friends :)</p>— Michael Jackson (@mjackson) <a href="https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/652554478571270144">October 9, 2015</a></blockquote></div>
<div class="section" id="thoughts">
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>What lessons can we learn from this?</p>
<p>Collaborative hacking sessions are a good thing. They're common in the
Python world and called "sprints". They're regularly organized in
association with Python conferences. At React Europe we had a micro
sprint: just two people, myself and Lee, working on infrastructure
code, with a bit of encouragement from Dan. Imagine what could be
accomplished with a larger group of people?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If a mini hackathon of 2 people can create reselect, who knows what else can happen? see also: <a href="http://t.co/dGkAqySec8">http://t.co/dGkAqySec8</a></p>— Martijn Faassen (@faassen) <a href="https://twitter.com/faassen/status/652132745217380352">October 8, 2015</a></blockquote><p>I admit the circumstances were special: Lee picked an idea that was
ready and could be done in a day. It also might have helped I have
previous sprint experience. Not every sprint has the same results. But
at the very least people get to know each other and learn new
things. I think a collaborative goal works better for this than a
contest. One major reason we go to open source conferences after all
is to meet new people and see old friends again, and a sprint can help
with that. I've made life-long friends through sprints.</p>
<p>The React Europe organization already picked up on this idea and is
planning to do a sprint for its conference next year. I already got my
tickets for 2016 and I'm looking forward to that! I hope more people
in the JavaScript lingua franca community pick up on this idea.</p>
<p>The other lesson I learned is more personal. I used to be part of a
larger open source community centered around Zope. But for various
reasons that community stopped being creative and is slowly fading
out; I wrote a blog series about <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/my-exit-from-zope.html">my exit from Zope</a>. I was a large
player in the Zope community for quite a few years. In contrast I'm a
bit player in the React community. But I greatly enjoy the community's
creativity and the connections I'm making. I missed that in my open
source life and I'm glad it's coming back.</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div><p>GraphQL is an interesting technology originating at Facebook. It is a
query language that lets you get JSON results from a server. It's
<em>not</em> a database system but can work with any kind of backend
structure. It tries to solve the same issues traditionally solved by
HTTP "REST-ish" APIs.</p>
<div class="section" id="some-problems-with-rest">
<h2>Some problems with REST</h2>
<p>When you do a REST-ish HTTP API, you expose information about the
server on a bunch of URLs. These URLs each return some data, typically
JSON. You can also update the server using HTTP methods, such as
<tt class="docutils literal">POST</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">PUT</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">DELETE</tt>. The client-side code needs to know
what URLs exist on the system and construct URLs based on what it
wants to know. If your REST-ish HTTP API is also a proper REST API
(aka a hypermedia API), you make sure that all information can
actually be accessed without constructing URLs but by following links
(or doing search requests) instead -- this is more loosely coupled but
also more difficult to implement.</p>
<p>But REST-ish HTTP APIs have some problems:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>spamminess</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Imagine you have person resources and address resources.
If you have a UI on the client that shows a person's address, you
will have to access both resources on separate URLs. This can easily
add up to a lot of requests from the client to the server. This not
only causes network traffic but can also make it harder to program
the client, especially if you can only do a new request based on
information you got in another response.</p>
<p class="last">You can reduce this problem by embedding information -- a person
resource has address information directly embedded in it. But
there's no standard way to control what gets embedded and this makes
the next issue worse.</p>
</dd>
<dt>too much information</dt>
<dd>In a HTTP API, you want to send out as much information about a
resource as possible, even if a particular UI doesn't need it. This
means that there is more network traffic, and possibly more work
done on the server to generate the data even though it's not needed.</dd>
<dt>too little information</dt>
<dd>There is typically rather little machine-readable metadata that
describes what the information on the server really exists. Having
such information can really help with tooling, and this in turn can
help avoid bugs. There are emerging specifications that tackle this,
but they're not commonly used.</dd>
</dl>
<p>REST will be here to stay for the foreseeable future. There is also
nothing inherent in REST that stops you from solving this -- I wrote
about this in a <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/graphql-and-rest.html">previous blog entry</a>. But meanwhile GraphQL has
already solved much of this stuff, so at the very least is interesting
to explore.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="graphql">
<h2>GraphQL</h2>
<p>GraphQL introduces a query language that lets the client express what
it really wants from the server. A single request with this query goes
to the server, and the server comes back with a complete structure
with everything that's needed for a particular state of the UI. To get
person information with its address information embedded, you can
write something like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">{
  person(id: 101) {
    fullname,
    address {
      street
      number
      postalCode
      city
      country
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>You get back JSON like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">{
  "person":
    "fullname": "Bob Lasereyes',
    "address: {
      "street": "Laserstreet",
      "number": "77",
      "postalCode": "XYZQ",
      "city": "Super City",
      "country": "Mutantia"
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Check the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/facebook/graphql/blob/master/README.md">GraphQL readme</a> for much more.</p>
<p>This solves the issues with RESTish HTTP APIs:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>less spamminess</dt>
<dd>To represent a single UI state you can typically get away with doing
just a single request to the server specifying everything you need. The
server then gives you a single response.</dd>
<dt>the right amount of information</dt>
<dd>You only get the information you ask for, nothing more, nothing less.</dd>
<dt>enough meta information</dt>
<dd>The server has a schema (which tools can introspect) that describes
exactly what kind of data you can access.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="relay">
<h2>Relay</h2>
<p>If you use GraphQL with the React UI library there's another project
from Facebook you can use with it: <a class="reference external" href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a>. Relay lets you declare what
data you want (using GraphQL), co-locate GraphQL snippets with the
bits of UI that need it, so your UIs are more composable and can be
rearranged more easily, and has a sophisticated system to help with
mutations, so that you display the updated information in the
UI as quickly as possible without re-fetching too much data.</p>
<p>It's cool, it's just new, I want to explore it to see whether it can
tackle some of my use cases and make life easier for developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="on-the-server-side">
<h2>On the server side</h2>
<p>So Relay and GraphQL are interesting and cool. So what do we need to
start using it? To use React with Relay on the client side to build
UIs, we need a Relay-compliant GraphQL server.</p>
<p>Facebook released a reference implementation of GraphQL, in
JavaScript: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js">graphql-js</a>.  It also released a library to help make a
GraphQL server Relay compliant, again in JavaScript:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-relay-js">graphql-relay-js</a>. It also released a server that exposes GraphQL
over HTTP, again in JavaScript: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql">express-graphql</a>.</p>
<p>That's all very cool if your server is in JavaScript. But what if your
server is in Python? Luckily the Facebook people anticipated this and
GraphQL is not bound to JavaScript. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://facebook.github.io/graphql/">GraphQL draft
specification</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/graphql-relay-specification.html">GraphQL Relay specification</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-python-graphql-stack">
<h2>The Python GraphQL stack</h2>
<p>Last week I started exploring the state of the GraphQL stack in Python
on the server. I was very pleased to find that it was in good shape already:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dittos/graphqllib">graphqllib</a>: this is an implementation of GraphQL by Taeho Kim
with contributions by an emerging open source community around
it. Lots of contributions are by Jake Heinz, who was also very
helpful in discussions on the Slack chat (<cite>#python</cite> at
<a class="reference external" href="https://graphql-slack.herokuapp.com/">https://graphql-slack.herokuapp.com/</a>).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/syrusakbary/graphql-relay-py">graphql-relay-py</a>: an implementation of <cite>graphql-relay-js</cite> for Python by
Syrus Akbary, so we can make our GraphQL Relay server
more compliant.</li>
</ul>
<p>The piece that was missing was actually using this stack as a backend
for a React + Relay frontend. Was it mature enough to do this? I
figured I'd give it a try. So I set out to port the one missing piece
to Python, the HTTP web server. So I took <cite>express-graphql</cite> and ported
over its code and tests to Python + WSGI using WebOb. The result is
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/faassen/wsgi_graphql">wsgi_graphql</a>, a WSGI component that offers the same HTTP API as
<cite>express-graphql</cite>.</p>
<p>It was a fun little exercise. I found a few issues in <cite>graphqllib</cite>
while doing so, and they're fixed already. I even found a minor bug
in <cite>express-graphql</cite> while doing so, which is fixed as well.</p>
<p>So does it work? Can you use React and Relay on the frontend with
Python on the backend? I created a demo project, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/faassen/relaypy">relaypy</a>, that
experimentally pulls all these pieces together. It exposes a GraphQL
server with a Relay-compliant schema. I hooked up some simple React +
Relay code on the frontend. <em>It worked!</em> In addition, I threw in a cool introspection/query UI
that was created for GraphQL called <cite>GraphiQL</cite>. This works too!</p>
<p>Should you be using this stuff in the real world? No, not yet. There
are big warning letters on the graphqllib project that it's <strong>highly
experimental</strong>. But while it's all very early days for these
components, but the Python support has come very far in just a few
short months -- GraphQL was only released as a public project in July,
and Relay is even younger. I expect that in a short time this stuff
will be ready for production and we'll have a capable GraphQL stack in
Python that we can use with React and Relay.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bonus-graphene">
<h2>Bonus: Graphene</h2>
<p>Emerging just last week as well was <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/syrusakbary/graphene">graphene</a>, which a very new
library by Syrus Akbary to make implementing GraphQL servers more
Pythonic. The API offered by <cite>graphqllib</cite> is rather low-level, which
is nice as it's very flexible, but for many Python projects you'd like
to use something more Pythonic. Graphene promises to be that API.</p>

<h4><a href="http://cosent.nl/en/blog/plone-intranet-plan-to-reality">Plone Intranet: from plan to reality</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>
In the fall of 2014 we 
<a href="http://cosent.nl/en/blog/plone-intranet-consortium">announced</a>
the formation of the 
<a href="http://ploneintranet.com">Plone Intranet Consortium</a> -
a collaboration between Plone technology companies to develop a Plone based
open source digital workplace platform.
</p>
<p>
Fast-forward to summer 2015: we've already done a 
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ploneintranet/0.1">Mercury "technology preview" release</a>
and are now in feature freeze, preparing for the 1.0 release, codename Venus, this summer.
</p>
<p>
As you can see in the video, for all of us it's very important to be part of the open source community
that is Plone.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, we use a different process: design driven, which impacts our code structure
and the way integrators can leverage the Plone Intranet platform.
</p>

<h3>Sharing and re-use</h3>

<p>
All of our code is open source and <a href="https://github.com/ploneintranet/ploneintranet">available on Github.</a>
In terms of re-use we have a mixed strategy:
</p>
<p>
First of all it's important to realize we're doing a design-driven
product, not a framework. We have a vision and many components are
closely integrated in the user experience (UX). From a UX perspective, all of Plone
Intranet is an integrated experience. Sure you can customize that but
you have to customize holistically. You cannot rip out a single feature
and expect the UX for that to stand on it's own.
</p>
<p>
In the backend the situation is completely different. All
the constituent packages are separate even if they live in one repo
and one egg. You can install ploneintranet.microblog without installing
the whole ploneintranet stack: i.e. the whole ploneintranet source needs
to be there (at the python level) but you can load only the
ploneintranet.microblog ZCML and GS and you'll be fine. All our packages
have their own test suites which are run independently. Of course you
need activitystream views to display the microblog - and that's frontend
UX and one of the most complex and integrated parts of our stack, with
AJAX injections, mentions, tagging, content mirroring and file preview
generation.
</p>
<p>
Another example is search: a completely re-usable backend but you'd
have to provide your own frontend. Our backend is pluggable - we
currently support both ZCatalog and Solr engines and expect to also
support Elastic Search in the future. 
We have documented our
<a href="http://docs.ploneintranet.org/development/components/search.html#why-not-collective-solr">
reasons for not reusing collective.solr.</a>
</p>

<h3>Design and user experience are key</h3>
<p>
We don't believe that loosely coupled components with
independent developer-generated frontends create a compelling user
experience. Instead of working from the backend towards the frontend, we
work the other way around and focus on creating a fully integrated,
beautiful user experience.
</p>
<p>
The downside of that is that it becomes more
difficult to reuse components independently. That's a painful choice
because obviously it reduces open source sharing opportunities.
We do open source for a reason, and
you can see much evidence that we care about that in 
<a href="http://docs.ploneintranet.org">the level of our
documentation</a>, in our code quality, and in the careful way we've
maintained independent backend packages, including listing component
package dependencies, providing full browser
layer isolation and most recently providing clean uninstallers for all
our packages.
</p>
<p>
Plone Intranet is a huge investment, and we're donating all our code
to the Plone community. We hope to establish a strong intranet sub-community
while at the same time strengthening the vibrancy of the Plone community
as a whole.

<h4><a href="https://www.fourdigits.nl/blog/plone-api-1-3-3-released">plone.api 1.3.3 released</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<h2>What has changed in version 1.3.3?</h2>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://docs.plone.org/external/plone.api/docs/">documentation</a> has been cleaned and updated!</p>
<h3>Plone 5 compatibility</h3>
<p>plone.api is now compatible with Plone 5. This includes registry based mail settings.<br />Note: The Plone 5 test setup uses plone.app.contenttypes instead of Archetypes.</p>
<h3>Find content objects</h3>
<p><a href="http://docs.plone.org/external/plone.api/docs/content.html#find-content-objects">plone.api.content.find</a> wraps the portal_catalog tool. It packs a bit of convenience that cleans up your code quite a bit.<br />The 'context' argument is used to construct the 'path' query:</p>
<pre># new<br />find(context=context)<br /># old<br />catalog(path='/'.join(context.getPhysicalPath()))</pre>
<p>The interfaces' __identifier__ is automatically used for the 'object_provides' argument.</p>
<pre># new<br />find(object_provides=IContentish)<br />find(object_provides=[IATDocument, IDexterityItem])<br />or find(object_provides=IContentish.__identifier__)<br /># old <br />catalog(object_provides=IContentish.__identifier__)<br />catalog(object_provides=[IATDocument.__identifier__, IDexterityItem.__identifier__])</pre>
<h3>Products.PrintingMailHost support</h3>
<p>plone.api.portal.send_email no longer raises ValueError('MailHost is not configured.') when Products.PrintingMailHost is installed and active.</p>
<h3>Support Zope users in env.adopt_user.</h3>
<p><a href="http://docs.plone.org/external/plone.api/docs/env.html#switch-user-inside-a-block">plone.api.env.adopt_user</a>(username='zope_admin') now works as expected.</p>
<h3>get_registry_record lists a subset of registry keys on error.</h3>
<p><a href="http://docs.plone.org/external/plone.api/docs/portal.html#get-plone-app-registry-record">plone.api.portal.get_registry_record</a> no longer lists all registry keys. It now lists only keys that contain the passed in record name, instead of all 1500+ keys.</p>
<h3>Revoking user roles</h3>
<p>Fixed <a href="http://docs.plone.org/external/plone.api/docs/user.html#revoke-roles-from-user">revoke_roles</a> method: now if is't called with obj parameter, it doesn't set inherited roles locally.</p>
<h3>Get View</h3>
<p><a href="http://docs.plone.org/external/plone.api/docs/content.html#get-view">plone.api.content.get_view</a> no longer swallows exception. This means that get_view no longer raises InvalidParameterError when there's an error in the view's __init__.</p>
<h3>Deleting multiple objects at once</h3>
<p><a href="http://docs.plone.org/external/plone.api/docs/content.html#delete-content">plone.api.content.delete</a> now accepts a list of objects.</p>
<h3>Products.Archetypes is o<span>ptional </span></h3>
<p>plone.api now can be used without Products.Archetypes.</p>
<h3>Default value for plone.api.content.get_state</h3>
<p><a class="external-link" href="http://docs.plone.org/external/plone.api/docs/api/content.html#plone.api.content.get_state" target="_self" title="">plone.api.content.get_state</a> now allows for an optional default value. <span>This is used when no workflow is defined for the object.</span></p>
<pre># new<br />state = get_state(obj=context, default=None)<br />if state is None:<br />    # Do something<br /># old<br />try:<br />    state = get_state(obj=context)<br />except WorkflowException:<br />    # Do something </pre>

<h4><a href="https://www.fourdigits.nl/blog/anniversary-sprint">Make it beautiful</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p class=" ">This week we welcome 30 sprinters to our office, the eight Four Digits and our frequent Seats2Meet guests. Up to 50 people on the office? Not a problem at all!</p>
<h3>What is a Sprint?</h3>
<p>The basic idea of a Plone Sprint is to get a large group of people together at one location and let them work for a week on Plone features. This makes it easier to communicate complex ideas and write complex code.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="anniversary sprint people working" class="image-inline" src="https://www.fourdigits.nl/images/anniversary-sprint-people-working.jpg/@@images/6f524ced-681b-43f9-a91c-40bc006554f1.jpeg" title="anniversary sprint people working" /></p>
<p>The topics defined for this sprint are</p>
<ul>
<li>Plone 5</li>
<li>Restful API</li>
<li>Plone Intranet</li>
<ul>All sprinters can join a group and the group will work on different sets of work to be done to create an end product. The main goal is: 'Make it beautiful'.</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Why Sprint?</h3>
<p>At a sprint you have direct contact with community members, as well as time to work on things. This can be small issues or big complex sub products like the new toolbar in Plone 5.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="anniversary sprint philip at piano" class="image-inline" src="https://www.fourdigits.nl/images/anniversary-sprint-philip-at-piano.jpg/@@images/7324ffdd-b16c-4229-825a-4f8e3978def8.jpeg" title="anniversary sprint philip at piano" /><br />And you can sit anywhere!</p>
<h3>Four Digits 10th Anniversary</h3>
<p>This year is Four Digits' 10th anniversary! We started small and are now able to organise sprints and conferences like the one in 2012 in Arnhem. We still use Plone a lot and are a big fan of the security model. Here's to Plone 5 and to the next ten years!</p></div>

<div class="entrygroup" id="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/thoughts-about-react-europe.html">
<h4 lang="en"><a href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/thoughts-about-react-europe.html">Thoughts about React Europe</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div><p>Last week I visited the React Europe conference in Paris; it was the
first such event in Europe and the second React conference in the
world. Paris like much of the rest of western Europe during this early
July was insanely hot. The airconditioning at the conference location
had trouble keeping up, and bars and restaurants were more like
saunas. Nonetheless, much was learned and much fun was had. I'm glad I
went!</p>
<p>React, in case you're not aware, is a frontend JavaScript
framework. There are a lot of those. I wrote one myself years ago
(before it was cool; I'm a frontend framework hipster) called
<a class="reference external" href="http://obviel.org">Obviel</a>. React appeals to me because it's component driven and because
it makes so many complexities go away with its approach to state.</p>
<p>Another reason I really like React is because its community is so
creative. I missed being involved with such a creative community after
my exit from <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/my-exit-from-zope.html">Zope</a>, which was due in large part as it had become less
creative. A lot of the web is being rethought by the React
community. Whether all of those ideas are good remains to be seen, but
it's certainly exciting and good will come from it.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of my experiences at the conference, with some
suggestions for the conference organizers sprinkled in. They did
a great job, but this way I hope to help them make it even
better.</p>
<div class="section" id="hackathon">
<h2>Hackathon</h2>
<p>When I heard there would be a hackathon the day before the conference,
I immediately signed up. This would be a great way to meet other
developers in the React community, work on some open source
infrastructure software together, and learn from them. Then a few days
before travel I learned there was a contest and prizes. Contest?
Prizes? I was somewhat taken aback!</p>
<p>I come from the tradition of sprints in the Python world. Sprints in
the Python community originated with the Zope project, and go back
to 2001. Sprints can be 1-3 day affairs held either before or after a
Python conference. The dedicated sprint is also not uncommon:
interested developers gather together somewhere for a few days,
sometimes quite a few days, to work on stuff together. This can be a
small group of 4 people in someone's offices, or 10 people in a
converted barn in the woods, or 30 people in a castle, or even more
people in a hotel on a snowy alpine mountain in the winter. I've
experienced all of that and more.</p>
<p>What do people do at such sprints? People hack on open source
infrastructure together. Beginners are onboarded into projects by more
experienced developers. New projects get started. People discuss new
approaches. They get to know each other, and learn from each
other. They party. Some sprints have more central coordination than
others. A sprint is a great way to get to know other developers and do
open source together in a room instead of over the internet.</p>
<p>I previously thought the word hackathon to be another word for
sprint. But a contest makes people compete with each other, and a
sprint is all about collaboration instead.</p>
<p>Luckily I chatted a bit online before the conference and quickly
enough found another developer who wanted to work with me on open
source stuff, turning it into a proper sprint after all. We put
together <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/faassen/reselect">this little library</a> as a result. I also met Dan
Abramov. I'll get back to him later.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the beautiful Mozilla offices in Paris where the
sprint was held, it felt like a library -- everybody was quietly
nestled behind their own laptop. I was afraid to speak, though
characteristically that didn't last long. I may have made a comment
that I thought hackathons aren't supposed to be ibraries. We got a bit
more noise after that.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this sprint (as that is what it became after
all), and learned a lot. Meanwhile the hackathon went well too for the
three Dutch friends I traveled with -- they won the contest!</p>
<p>React Europe organizers, I'd like to request a bit more room for
sprint-like collaboration at the next conference. In open source we
want to emphasize collaboration more than competition, don't we?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conference">
<h2>Conference</h2>
<p>The quality of the talks of the conference was excellent; they
got me thinking, which I enjoy. I'll discuss some of the trends and
list a few talks that stood out to me personally; my selection has
more to do with my personal interests than the quality of the talks I
won't mention, though.</p>
<div class="section" id="inline-styles-and-animations">
<h3>Inline styles and animations</h3>
<p>Michael Chan gave a talk about Inline Styles. React is about
encapsulating bits of UI into coherent components. But styling was
originally left up to external CSS, apart from the components. It
doesn't have to be. The React community has been exploring ways to put
style information into components as well, in part replacing CSS
altogether. This is definitely a rethinking of best practices that
will cause some resistance, but definitely very interesting. I will
have to explore some of the libraries for doing this that have emerged
in the React community; perhaps they will fit my developer brain
better than CSS has so far.</p>
<p>There were two talks about how you might define animations as well
with React. I especially liked Cheng Lou's talk where he explored
declarative ways to express animations. Who knows, maybe even
unstylish programmers like myself will end up doing animation!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="graphql-and-relay">
<h3>GraphQL and Relay</h3>
<p>Lee Byron (creator of <a class="reference external" href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">immutable-js</a>) gave a talk about
GraphQL. GraphQL is rethinking client/server communication originating
at Facebook. Instead of leaving it up to the web server to determine
the shape of the data the client code sees, GraphQL lets that be
expressed by the client code. The idea is that the developer of the
client UI code knows better that data they need than the server
developer does (even if these are the same person). This has some
performance benefits as well as it can be used to minimize network
traffic. Most important to be me is that it promises a better way of
client UI development: the data arrives in the shape the client
developer needs already.</p>
<p>Lee announced the immediate release of a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/facebook/graphql">GraphQL introduction</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://facebook.github.io/graphql/">GraphQL draft specification</a> and a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js">reference implementation in
JavaScript</a>, resolving a <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/graphql-and-rest.html">criticism</a> I had in a previous blog post. I
started reading the spec that night (I had missed out on the intro;
it's a better place to start!).</p>
<p>Joseph Savona gave a talk about the Relay project, which is a way to
integrate GraphQL with React. The idea is to specify what data a
component needs not only on the client, but right next to the UI
components that need it. Before the UI is rendered, the required data
is composed into a larger GraphQL query and the data is
retrieved. Relay aims to solve a lot of the hard parts of
client/server communication in a central framework, making various
complexities go away for UI developers. Joseph announced an open
source release of Relay for around August. I'm looking forward to
learn more about Relay then.</p>
<p>Dan Schafer and Nick Schrock gave a talk about what implementing a
GraphQL server actually looks like. GraphQL is a query language, not a
database system. It is designed to integrate with whatever backend
services you already have, not replace them. This is good as it
requires much less buy-in and you can evolve your systems towards
GraphQL incrementally -- this was Facebook's own use case as well. To
expose your service's data as GraphQL you need to give a server
GraphQL framework a description of what your server data looks like
and some code on how to obtain this data from the underlying services.</p>
<p>Both Dan and Nick spent the break after their talk answering a lot of
questions by many interested developers, including myself. I spoke to
Dan myself and I'm really grateful for all his informative answers.</p>
<p>The GraphQL and Relay developers at Facebook are explicitly hoping to
build a real open source community around this technology, and they
made a flying start this conference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flux">
<h3>Flux</h3>
<p>All this GraphQL and Relay stuff is exciting, but the way most people
integrate React with backends at present is through variations on the
<a class="reference external" href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html">Flux pattern</a>. There were several talks that touched upon Flux
during the conference. The talk that stood out was by Dan Abramov, who
I mentioned earlier. This talk has already been released as an online
video, and I recommend you <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs">watch it</a>. In it Dan develops and debugs
a client-side application live, and due to the ingenious architecture
behind it, he can modify code and see the changes in the application's
behavior immediately, without an explicit reload and <em>without having
to reenter data</em>. It was really eye-opening.</p>
<p>What makes this style of development possible is a more purely
functional approach towards the Flux pattern. Dan started the <a class="reference external" href="https://rackt.github.io/redux/">Redux</a>
framework, which focuses on making this kind of thing
possible. Instead of definining methods that describe how to store
data in some global store object, in Redux you define pure functions
instead (reducers) that describe how to transform the store state into
a new state.</p>
<p>Dan Abramov is interesting by himself. He has quickly made a big name
for himself in the React community by working on all sorts of exciting
new software and approaches, while being very approachable at the same
time. He's doing open source right. He's also in his early 20s. I'm
old enough to have run into very smart younger developers before, so
his success is not <em>too</em> intimidating for me. I'll try to learn from
what he does right and apply it in my own open source work.</p>
<p>The purely functional reducer pattern was all over the conference; I
saw references to it in several other talks, especially Kevin
Robinson's talk on simplifying the data layer, which explored the
power of keeping a log of actions. It has its applications on both
clients and servers.</p>
<p>The React web framework already set the tone: it makes some powerful
functional programming techniques surrounding UI state management
available in a JavaScript framework. The React community is now mining
more functional programming techniques, making them accessible to
JavaScript developers. It's interesting times.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-react-s-component-nature">
<h3>Using React's component nature</h3>
<p>There were several talks that touch on how you can use React's
component nature. Ryan Florence gave an entertaining talk about you
can incrementally rewrite an existing client-side application to use
React components, step by step. Aria Buckles gave a talk on writing
good reusable components with React; I recognized several mistakes
I've made in my code and better ways to do it.</p>
<p>Finally in a topic close to my heart Evan Morikawa and Ben Gotow gave
a talk about how to use React and Flux to turn applications into
extensible platforms. Extensible platforms are all over software
development. CMSes are a very common example in web development. One
could even argue having an extensible core that supports multiple
customers with customizations is the mystical quality that turns an
application into "enterprise software".</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dx-developer-experience">
<h2>DX: Developer Experience</h2>
<p>The new abbreviation DX was used in a lot of talks. DX stands for
"Developer Experience" in analogy with UX standing for "user
experience".</p>
<p>I've always thought about this concept as usability for developers: a
good library or framework offers a good user interface for developers
who want to build stuff with it. A library or framework isn't there
just to let developers get some done, but to let them get this stuff
done well: smoothly, avoiding common mistakes, and not letting them
down when they need to do something special.</p>
<p>I really appreciated the React community's emphasis on DX. Let's make
the easy things easy, and the hard things possible, together.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gender-diversity">
<h2>Gender Diversity</h2>
<p>This section is not intended as devastating criticism but as a
suggestion. I'm not an expert on this topic at all, but I did want to
make this observation.</p>
<p>I've attended a lot of Python conferences over the years. The gender
balance at these conferences was in the early years much more like the
React Europe conference: mostly men with a few women here and
there. But in recent years there has been a big push in the Python
community, especially in North America, to change the gender balance
at these conferences and the community as a whole. With success: these
days PyCons in North America attract over 30% women attendees. While
EuroPython still has a way to go, last year I already noticed a
definite trend towards more women speaking and attending. It was a
change I appreciated.</p>
<p>Change like this doesn't happen by itself. React Europe made a good
start by adopting a code of conduct. We can learn more about what
other conference organizers do. Closer to the React community I've
also appreciated the actions of the JSConf Europe organizers in this
direction. Some simple ideas include to actively reach out to women to
submit their talk and to reach out to user groups.</p>
<p>Of course, for all I know this was in fact done, in which case do
please do keep it up! If not, that's my suggestion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusions">
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed this conference. There were a lot of interesting
talks; too many to go into here. I met a lot of interesting
people. Mining functional programming techniques to benefit mere
mortal developers such as myself, and developer experience in general,
are clearly major trends in the React community.</p>
<p>Now that I'm home I'm looking forward to exploring these ideas and
technologies some more. Thank you organizers, speakers and fellow
attendees! And then to think the conference will likely get even
better next year! I hope I can make it again.</p>

<h4 lang="en"><a href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/morepath-batching-example.html">Build a better batching UI with Morepath and Jinja2</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div><div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This post is the first in what I hope will be a series on neat things
you can do with <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org">Morepath</a>. Morepath is a Python web micro framework
with some very interesting capabilities. What we'll look at today is
what you can do with Morepath's link generation in a server-driven web
application. While Morepath is an excellent fit to create REST APIs,
it also works well server aplications. So let's look at how Morepath
can help you to create a batching UI.</p>
<p>On the special occasion of this post we also released a new version of
Morepath, <a class="reference external" href="https://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/0.11.1/changes.html">Morepath 0.11.1</a>!</p>
<p>A batching UI is a UI where you have a larger amount of data available
than you want to show to the user at once. You instead partition the
data in smaller batches, and you let the user navigate through these
batches by clicking a <em>previous</em> and <em>next</em> link. If you have 56 items
in total and the batch size is 10, you first see items 0-9. You can
then click <em>next</em> to see items 10-19, then items 20-29, and so on until
you see the last few items 50-55. Clicking <em>previous</em> will take you
backwards again.</p>
<p>In this example, a URL to see a single batch looks like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">http://example.com/?start=20
</pre>
<p>To see items 20-29. You can also approach the application like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">http://example.com/
</pre>
<p>to start at the first batch.</p>
<p>I'm going to highlight the relevant parts of the application here. The
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/morepath/morepath_batching">complete example project</a> can be found on Github. I have included
instructions on how to install the app in the README.rst there.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="model">
<h2>Model</h2>
<p>First we need to define a few model classes to define the
application. We are going to go for a fake database of fake persons
that we want to batch through.</p>
<p>Here's the <cite>Person</cite> class:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">address</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">email</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">id</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">name</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">address</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">address</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">email</span>
</pre>
<p>We use the neat <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fake-factory">fake-factory</a> package to create some fake data

<p>So far nothing special. But next we create a special

</pre>
<p>To create an instance of <cite>PersonCollection</cite> you need two arguments:
<cite>persons</cite>, which is going to be our <cite>person_db</cite> we created before, and
<cite>start</cite>, which is the start index of the batch.</p>
<p>We define a <cite>query</cite> method that queries the persons we need from the
larger batch, based on <cite>start</cite> and a global constant,
<cite>BATCH_SIZE</cite>. Here we do this by simply taking a slice. In a real
application you'd execute some kind of database query.</p>
<p>We also define <cite>previous</cite> and <cite>next</cite> methods. These give back the
previous <cite>PersonCollection</cite> and next <cite>PersonCollection</cite>. They use the
same <cite>persons</cite> database, but adjust the <cite>start</cite> of the batch. If there
is no previous or next batch as we're at the beginning or the end,
these methods return <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt>.</p>
<p>There is nothing directly web related in this code, though of course
<cite>PersonCollection</cite> is there to serve our web application in
particular. But as you notice there is absolutely no interaction with
<cite>request</cite> or any other parts of the Morepath API. This makes it easier
to reason about this code: you can for instance write unit tests that
just test the behavior of these instances without dealing with
requests, HTML, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="path">
<h2>Path</h2>
<p>Now we expose these models to the web. We tell Morepath what models
are behind what URLs, and how to create URLs to models:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><span class="nd">@App.path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">model</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">PersonCollection</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'/'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_person_collection</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">start</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">PersonCollection</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">person_db</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">start</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nd">@App.path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">model</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Person</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'{id}'</span><span class="p">,</span>
          <span class="n">converters</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s">'id'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">})</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_person</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">person_db</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">IndexError</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre>
<p>Let's look at this in more detail:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><span class="nd">@App.path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">model</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">PersonCollection</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'/'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_person_collection</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">start</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">PersonCollection</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">person_db</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">start</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>This is not a lot of code, but it actually tells Morepath a lot:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When you go to the root path <cite>/</cite> you get the instance returned by the
<cite>get_person_collection</cite> function.</li>
<li>This URL takes a request parameter <cite>start</cite>, for instance <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">?start=10</span></tt>.</li>
<li>This request parameter is optional. If it's not given it defaults to <cite>0</cite>.</li>
<li>Since the default is a Python <cite>int</cite> object, Morepath rejects any
requests with request parameters that cannot be converted to an
integer as a 400 Bad Request. So <cite>?start=11</cite> is legal, but
<cite>?start=foo</cite> is not.</li>
<li>When asked for the link to a <cite>PersonCollection</cite> instance in Python
code, as we'll see soon, Morepath uses this information to
reconstruct it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let's look at <cite>get_person</cite>:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><span class="nd">@App.path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">model</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Person</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'{id}'</span><span class="p">,</span>
          <span class="n">converters</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s">'id'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">})</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_person</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">person_db</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">IndexError</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre>
<p>This uses a path with a parameter in it, <cite>id</cite>, which is passed to the
<cite>get_person</cite> function. It explicitly sets the system to expect an
<cite>int</cite> and reject anything else, but we could've used <cite>id=0</cite> as a
default parameter instead here too. Finally, <cite>get_person</cite> can return
<cite>None</cite> if the id is not known in our Python list "database". Morepath
automatically turns this into a <cite>404 Not Found</cite> for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="view-template-for-person">
<h2>View &amp; template for Person</h2>
<p>While <cite>PersonCollection</cite> and <cite>Person</cite> instances now have a URL, we
didn't tell Morepath yet what to do when someone goes there. So for
now, these URLs will respond with a 404.</p>
<p>Let's fix this by defining some Morepath views. We'll do a simple view
for <cite>Person</cite> first:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><span class="nd">@App.html</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">model</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Person</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">template</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'person.jinja2'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">person_default</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s">'id'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s">'name'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s">'address'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">address</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s">'email'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">email</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
</pre>
<p>We use the <cite>html</cite> decorator to indicate that this view delivers data
of Content-Type <cite>text/html</cite>, and that it uses a <cite>person.jinja2</cite>
template to do so.</p>
<p>The <cite>person_default</cite> function itself gets a <cite>self</cite> and a <cite>request</cite>
argument.  The <cite>self</cite> argument is an instance of the model class
indicated in the decorator, so a <cite>Person</cite> instance. The request
argument is a <a class="reference external" href="http://webob.org/">WebOb</a> request instance. We give the template the data
returned in the dictionary.</p>
<p>The template <cite>person.jinja2</cite> looks like this:</p>
<pre class="code html+jinja literal-block"><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Morepath batching demo<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>
      Name: <span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">name</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="nt">&lt;br/&gt;</span>
      Address: <span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">address</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="nt">&lt;br/&gt;</span>
      Email: <span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">email</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="nt">&lt;br</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>Here we use the <a class="reference external" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja2 template language</a> to render the data to
HTML.  Morepath out of the box does not support Jinja2; it's template
language agnostic. But in our example we use the Morepath extension
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/more.jinja2">more.jinja2</a> which integrates Jinja2. Chameleon support is also
available in <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/more.chameleon">more.chameleon</a> in case you prefer that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="view-template-for-personcollection">
<h2>View &amp; template for PersonCollection</h2>
<p>Here is the view that exposes <cite>PersonCollection</cite>:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><span class="nd">@App.html</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">model</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">PersonCollection</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">template</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'person_collection.jinja2'</span><span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="s">'persons'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="p">(),</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
</pre>
<p>It gives the template the list of persons that is in the current
<cite>PersonCollection</cite> instance so it can show them in a template as we'll
see in a moment. It also creates two URLs: <cite>previous_link</cite> and
<cite>next_link</cite>.  These are links to the previous and next batch
available, or <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> if no previous or next batch exists (this is
the first or the last batch).</p>
<p>Let's look at the template:</p>

</pre>
<p>A bit more is going on here. First it loops through the <cite>persons</cite> list
to show all the persons in a batch in a HTML table. The name in the
table is a link to the person instance; we use <cite>request.link()</cite> in the
template to create this URL.</p>
<p>The template also shows a <cite>previous</cite> and <cite>next</cite> link, but only if
they're not <cite>None</cite>, so when there is actually a previous or next batch
available.</p>

<h2>That's it</h2>
<p>And that's it, besides a few details of application setup, which you
can find in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/morepath/morepath_batching">complete example project</a> on Github.</p>
<p>There's not much to this code, and that's how it should be. I invite
you to compare this approach to a batching UI to what an
implementation for another web framework looks like. Do you put the
link generation code in the template itself? Or as ad hoc code inside
the view functions? How clear and concise and testable is that code
compared to what we just did here? Do you give back the right HTTP
status codes when things go wrong? Consider also how easy it would be
to expand the code to include searching in addition to batching.</p>
<p>Do you want to try out Morepath now? Read the <a class="reference external" href="https://morepath.readthedocs.org">very extensive
documentation</a>. I hope to hear from you!</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.fourdigits.nl/blog/reindex-speed-done-by-groups">Reindex speed done by groups</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>My problem was easy: when giving user rights using a ReferenceField to a top folder containing 40k objects I could get some coffee and lunch before my action was completed. This due to the fact Plone was reindexing <span>allowedUsersAndRoles</span> index on every single object in the folder and its sub folders. This would take up to 15 minutes and the action was fired several times a day.</p>
<p>Working on <a class="external-link" href="http://ploneintranet.com/" target="_self" title="">Plone Intranet</a> we came across <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/collective/collective.workspace" target="_self" title="">collective.workspace</a>, a simple implementation based on putting users in groups and giving groups rights on objects. This means all reindexing is done creating a single object, setting rights based on a group. When a user enters or leaves the group <strong>no</strong> objects are reindexed, meaning updating your security model is super quick! </p>
<pre>Normal:<br />- Folder<br />  - Subfolder<br />    - Subsubfolder  </pre>
<p>Adding user X to folder will include folder, subfolder and subsubfolder to be reindexed. Total time will be: (amount of time per object * num. objects).</p>
<pre>New:<br />- Folder  (groupX)<br />  - Subfolder  (groupX)<br />     - Subsubfolder    (groupX) </pre>
<pre><br />class Folder(Workspace):<br />    implements(IWorkspace)<br />    adapts(interfaces.IFolder)<br /><br />    @property<br />    def available_groups(self):<br />        groups = {<br />            'groupX': ['GroupXRights', ],}<br />       return groups<br /><br /></pre>
<p>No (re-)indexing is done when a user is added to groupX, because the group's permissions are already indexed. Group membership is global, so this works everywhere.</p>
<p>The only thing we had to do was remove all reindexobject calls in my events.py and create an event based on my security model, when to add or remove a member from the groups. </p>
<pre><br /># Events<br />def set_groups_and_members(context, event):<br />    # Edit event for all IHasWorkspace<br /> # Sets the members for the groups from the referencefields in context with<br /> # the same name. ie group 'groupX' contains members<br /> # from context.getGroupX()<br /><br /> group_memberships = defaultdict(list)<br /><br />    # Get members for the groups<br /> workspace = IWorkspace(context)<br />    logger.debug('%s' % workspace)<br />    for fieldname in workspace.available_groups:<br />        # Get the accessor and call to get the members<br />        field = context.schema.get(fieldname)<br />        for item in set(field.getAccessor(context)()):<br />            group_memberships[item.getId()].append(field.getName())<br /><br />    # add or update members<br /> for memberid, groups in group_memberships.items():<br />        if memberid not in workspace.members:<br />            workspace.add_to_team(memberid, groups)<br />        else:<br />            membership = workspace[memberid]<br />            membership.update(dict(groups=groups))<br /><br />    # Remove old members<br /> for memberid in set(workspace.members) - set(group_memberships):<br />        workspace.remove_from_team(memberid)</pre></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div><div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There is a new trend in open source that I'm not sure I like very
much: big companies announce that they are <em>going</em> to open source
something, but the release is nowhere in sight yet. Announcing
something invites feedback, especially if it's announced as open
source. When the software in question is available already as closed
source for people to play with I don't really mind as feedback is
possible, though it makes me wonder what the point is of holding back
on a release.</p>
<p>It's a bit more difficult to give feedback on something when the thing
announced is still heavily in development with no release in
sight. How can one give feedback? But since you announced you'd open
source it, I guess we should not be shy and give you feedback anyway.</p>
<p>Facebook has been doing this kind of announcement a lot recently: they
announced React Native before they released it. They also announced
Relay and GraphQL, but both have not yet been released. They've given
us some information in a few talks and blog posts, and the rest is
speculation. If you want to learn more about Relay and GraphQL I
highly recommend you read these <a class="reference external" href="https://speakerdeck.com/laneyk/mutations-in-relay">slides</a> by Laney Kuenzel.</p>
<p>From the information we do have, Relay looks very interesting
indeed. I think I'd like to have the option use Relay in the
future. That means I need to implement GraphQL somehow, or at least
something close enough to it, as it's the infrastructure that makes
Relay possible.</p>
<p>React is a rethink of how to construct a client-side web application
UI. React challenges MVC and bi-directional data binding. <a class="reference external" href="https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html">GraphQL</a> is
a rethink of the way client-side web applications talk to their
backend. GraphQL challenges REST.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rest">
<h2>REST</h2>
<p>So what was REST again? Rich frontend applications these days
typically talk to a HTTP backend. These backends follow some basic
REST patterns: resources are on URLs and you can interact with them
using HTTP verbs. Some resources represent single items:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">/users/faassen
</pre>
<p>If you issue a <tt class="docutils literal">GET</tt> request to it you get its representation,
typically in JSON. You can also issue a <tt class="docutils literal">PUT</tt> request to it to
overwrite its representation, and <tt class="docutils literal">DELETE</tt> to delete it.</p>
<p>In a HTTP API we typically also have a way to access collections:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">/users
</pre>
<p>You can issue <tt class="docutils literal">GET</tt> to this too, possibly with some HTTP query
parameters to do a filter, to get a representation of the users known
to the application. You can also issue <tt class="docutils literal">POST</tt> to this to add a new
user.</p>
<p>Real proper REST APIs, also known as Hypermedia APIs, go beyond this:
they have hyperlinks between resources. I wrote a web framework named
<a class="reference external" href="https://morepath.readthedocs.org/">Morepath</a> which aims to make it easier to create complex hypermedia
APIs, so you can say I'm pretty heavily invested in REST.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="challenging-rest">
<h2>Challenging REST</h2>
<p>GraphQL challenges REST. The core idea is that the code that best
knows what data is needed for a UI is not on the server but on the
client. The UI component knows best what data it wants.</p>
<p>REST delivers all the data a UI might need about a resource and it's
up to the client to go look for the bits it actually wants to show. If
that data is not in a resource it already has, the client needs to go
off to the server and request some more data from another URL.  With
GraphQL the UI gets exactly the data it needs instead, in a shape
handy for the UI.</p>
<p>As we can see <a class="reference external" href="https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html">here</a>, a GraphQL query looks like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"> {
   user(id: 400) {
     id,
     name,
     isViewerFriend,
     profilePicture(size: 50)  {
       uri,
       width,
       height
     }
   }
}
</pre>
<p>You get back this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">{
  "user" : {
    "id": 4000,
    "name": "Some name",
    "isViewerFriend": true,
    "profilePicture": {
      "uri": "http://example.com/pic.jpg",
      "width": 50,
      "height": 50
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>This says you want an object of type <tt class="docutils literal">user</tt> with <tt class="docutils literal">id</tt>
<tt class="docutils literal">4000</tt>. You are interested in its <tt class="docutils literal">id</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">name</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">isViewerFriend</tt> fields.</p>
<p>You also want another object it is connected to: the
<tt class="docutils literal">profilePicture</tt>. You want the <tt class="docutils literal">uri</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">width</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">height</tt>
fields of this. While there is no public GraphQL specification out
there yet, I <em>think</em> that <tt class="docutils literal">size: 50</tt> means to restrict the subquery
for a profile picture to only those of size
50. I'm not sure what happens if no <tt class="docutils literal">profilePicture</tt> of this size is
available, though.</p>
<p>To talk to the backend, there is only a single HTTP end-point that
receives all these queries, or alternatively you use a non-HTTP
mechanism like web sockets. Very unRESTful indeed!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rest-and-shaping-data">
<h2>REST and shaping data</h2>
<p>Since I'm invested in REST, I've been wondering about whether we can
bring some of these ideas to REST APIs. Perhaps we can even map
GraphQL to a REST API in a reasonably efficient way. But even if we
don't implement all of GraphQL, we might gain enough to make our REST
APIs more useful to front-end developers.</p>
<p>As an exercise, let's try to express the query above as a REST query
for a hypothetical REST API. First we take this bit:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">user(id: 4000) {
</pre>
<p>We can express this using a path:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">/users/4000
</pre>
<p>The client could construct this path by using a <a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570">URI template</a>
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/users/{id}</span></tt>) provided by the server, or by following a link
provided by the server, or by doing the least RESTful thing of them
all: hardcode the URL construction in client code.</p>
<p>How do we express with HTTP what fields a user wants? <strong>REST of course
does have a mechanism that can be used to shape data: HTTP query
parameters.</strong> So this bit:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">id,
name,
isViewerFriend,
</pre>
<p>could become these query parameters:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">?field=id&amp;field=name&amp;field=isViewerFriend
</pre>
<p>And the query would then look like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">/users/4000?field=id&amp;field=name&amp;field=isViewerFriend
</pre>
<p>That is pretty straightforward. It needs server buy-in, but it
wouldn't be very difficult to implement in the basic case. The
sub-query is more tricky. We need to think of some way to represent it
in query parameters. We could do something like this (multi-line for
clarity):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">?field=profilePicture&amp;
  filter:profilePicture.size=50&amp;
  field=profilePicture.uri&amp;
  field=profilePicture.width&amp;
  field=profilePicture.height
</pre>
<p>The whole query now looks like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">/users/4000?
  field=id&amp;
  field=name&amp;
  field=isViewerFriend&amp;
  field=profilePicture&amp;
  filter:profilePicture.size=50&amp;
  field=profilePicture.uri&amp;
  field=profilePicture.width&amp;
  field=profilePicture.height
</pre>
<p>The result of this query would look the same as in the GraphQL
example. It's important to notice that this REST API is not fully
<em>normalized</em> -- the <tt class="docutils literal">profilePicure</tt> data is not behind a separate
URL that the client then needs to go to. Instead, the object is
embedded in the result for the sake of convenience and performance.</p>
<p>I'd be tempted to make the server send back some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a> to help
here: each object (the user object and the profileData subobject) can
have an <tt class="docutils literal">@id</tt> for its canonical URL and a <tt class="docutils literal">@type</tt> as a type
designator. A client-side cache could exploit this <tt class="docutils literal">@id</tt> information
to store information about the objects it already knows
about. Client-side code could also use this information to deal with
normalized APIs transparently: it can automatically fetch the
sub-object for you if it's not embedded, at the cost of performance.</p>
<p>Does this REST API have the same features as the GraphQL example? I
have no idea. It probably depends especially on how queries of related
objects work. GraphQL does supply caching benefits, which you wouldn't
have without more work. On the other hand you might be able to exploit
HTTP-level caching mechanisms with this REST-based approach. Then
again, this has more HTTP overhead, which GraphQL can avoid.</p>
<p>Let's briefly get back to the idea to automatically map GraphQL to a
REST API. What is needed is a way to look up a <a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570">URI template</a> for a
GraphQL type.  So, for the <tt class="docutils literal">user</tt> type we could connect it to a URI
template <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/users/{id}</span></tt>. The server could supply this map of GraphQL
type to URI template to the server, so the server can make the
translation of the GraphQL to the REST API.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="further-speculation">
<h2>Further speculation</h2>
<p>What about queries for multiple objects? We could use some kind of
collection URL with a filter:</p>
<blockquote>
/user?filter:startsWith=a</blockquote>
<p>It is normal in REST to shape collection data this way already, after
all. Unfortunately I have no clear idea what a query for a collection
of objects looks like in GraphQL.</p>
<p>I've only vaguely started thinking about mutations. If you can access
the objects's URL in a standard way such as with an <tt class="docutils literal">@id</tt> field, you
can then get a handle on the object and send it <tt class="docutils literal">POST</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">PUT</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">DELETE</tt> requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All this is wild speculation, as we don't really know enough about
GraphQL yet to fully understand its capabilities. It's quite possible
that I'm throwing away some important property of GraphQL away by
mapping it to a REST API. Scalability, for instance. Then again,
usually my scalability use cases aren't the same as Facebook's, so I
might not care as long as I get Relay's benefits to client-side code
development.</p>
<p>It's also possible that it's actually easier to implement a single
GraphQL-based endpoint than to write or adapt a REST API to support
these patterns. Who knows.</p>
<p>Another question I don't have the answer to is what properties a
system should have to make Relay work at all. Does it need to be
exactly GraphQL, or would a subset of its features work? Which
properties of GraphQL are essential?</p>
<p>Thank you, GraphQL and Relay people, for challenging the status quo!
Though it makes me slightly uncomfortable, I greatly appreciate
it. Hopefully my feedback wasn't too dumb; luckily you can't blame me
too much for that as I can legitimately claim ignorance! I'm looking
forward to learning more.</p>

<div class="entrygroup" id="http://cosent.nl/en/blog/change-factory-knowledge-platform">
<h4><a href="http://cosent.nl/en/blog/change-factory-knowledge-platform">Change Factory Knowledge Platform</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>For Milieudefensie, the Dutch chapter of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.foei.org/">Friends of the Earth International</a>, Cosent
realised <a class="reference external" href="http://veranderfabriek.org">De Veranderfabriek</a> (The Change Factory), a platform where environmental activists share knowledge.</p>
<p>The site offers an online knowledge platform for the entire Dutch environmental movement.
The Change Factory is structured using a classical watch-learn-do approach:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Watch</dt>
<dd>The Knowledge Base provides searchable background information on various topics.</dd>
<dt>Learn</dt>
<dd>The Toolbox offers step-by-step help in organising a new initiative.</dd>
<dt>Do</dt>
<dd>The Network connects activists with each other and facilitates learning by sharing practical experiences.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The site is currently only available in Dutch. See the Dutch intro video to get a feel:</p>

<div class="section" id="knowledge-management-in-action">
<h3>Knowledge Management in action</h3>
<p>Effective knowledge management and sharing of knowledge results not just from
publishing documents ("explicit knowledge"). Much learning and knowledge sharing
results from the interactions between people, in which they exchange "tacit knowledge" -
stuff you know but didn't know you knew.</p>
<p>The Change Factory is designed to support both aspects, in the form of a knowledge base
with documents (explicit knowledge) on the one hand, and a social network geared towards
conversation and interpersonal contact (implicit knowledge sharing) on the other hand.
A toolbox with learning tools connects both aspects into a learning resource.</p>
<p>As a knowledge platform, the site supports a cycle of knowledge flow and knowledge creation
following the well-known <a class="reference external" href="http://cosent.nl/en/resources/knowledge-management/flow-management">SECI</a> model:</p>
<img alt="SECI diagram" src="http://cosent.nl/images/seci.jpg" />
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Socialization: sharing knowledge in conversation.</dt>
<dd>The network promotes direct contact and dialogue between environmental activists,
by not only describing the <em>what</em> of an activity, but also <em>who</em> the organisors are
and presenting their contact info. Additionally, a discussion facility on the network
makes it easy to exchange experiences.</dd>
<dt>Externalisation: writing down your knowledge.</dt>
<dd>The network is built around the exchange of "experiences", documenting an action format,
so people can learn from successes in another town and replicate the format.
This helps to articulate tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge.</dd>
<dt>Combination: searching and finding knowledge.</dt>
<dd>The searchable knowledge base, organised by theme, facilitates the re-use of knowledge.
Documented action formats in the network all follow the same stepwise model,
making it easy to mix and match steps from various formats in creating your own activity.</dd>
<dt>Internalization: turning learning into action.</dt>
<dd>The toolbox with process support documentation helps you assimilate <em>best practices</em>
by bringing them into practice, following a simple four-step plan.
Here, you absorb explicit <em>know-what</em> knowledge and internalize that into tacit <em>know-how</em>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>De combination of these approaches turns The Change Factory into much more than
just a set of documents. The site is a living whole where people communicate and
help each other to become more effective, in facilitating the transition of our society
to a more sustainable world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="realisation">
<h3>Realisation</h3>
<p>Following the initial project brief, Cosent performed design research in the form of
a series of interviews with intended users of The Change Factory. These interviews
inquired into the way activists collaborate and communicate in practice,
focusing on what people actually need and how a online platform could contribute
to their success.</p>
<p>What emerged from the research, is that nobody wants more long documents.
Nor was there any need for a marketplace-like exchange of services and support.
Rather the interviewees articulated a need for quick-win snippets of actionable knowledge that can
immediately be put into practice.</p>
<p>Based on the outcomes of this research, we introduced the Network aspect of the platform:
a social network centered on the sharing of succesful action formats, structured in a way
that facilitates dialogue, direct contact, and re-use of proven formats across multiple cities.</p>
<p>After articulating this concept into an interaction design and visual design, Cosent built
the site in <a class="reference external" href="http://plone.com">Plone CMS</a>. An initial crew of editors seeded the site with initial content.
Recently, the platform was publicly unveiled and immediately attracted scores of active users.</p>

<h4 lang="en"><a href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/server-templating-in-morepath-010.html">Server Templating in Morepath 0.10</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div><div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I just released Morepath 0.10 (<a class="reference external" href="https://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/0.10/changes.html">CHANGES</a>)! <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org">Morepath</a> is a modern Python
web framework that <strong>combines power with simplicity of use</strong>. Morepath
0.10's biggest new feature is <strong>server-side templating support</strong>.</p>
<p>Most Python web frameworks were born at a time when server-side
templating was the only way to get HTML content into a web
browser. Templates in the browser did not yet exist. Server templating
was a necessity for a server web framework, built-in from day 1.</p>
<p>The web has changed and much more can be done in the browser now: if
you want a web page, you can accomplish it with client-side JavaScript
code, helped by templates, or embedded HTML-like snippets in
JavaScript, like what the React framework does. Morepath is a web
framework that was born in this new era.</p>
<p>Morepath could take a more leisurely approach to server templating.
We recommend that users rely on client-side technology to construct a
UI -- something that Morepath is very good at supporting. For many web
applications, this approach is fine and leads to more responsive user
interfaces. It also has the benefit that it supports a strong
separation between user interface and underlying data. And you <em>could</em>
still use server template engines with Morepath, but with no help from
the framework.</p>
<p>But there is still room for server templates. Server-generated HTML
has its advantages. It's the easiest way to create a bookmarkable
traditional web site -- no client-side routing needed. For more
dynamic web applications it can also sometimes make sense to send a
server-rendered HTML page to the client as a starting point, and only
switch to a client-side dynamic code later. This is useful in those
cases where you want the end-user to see a web page as quickly as
possible: in that case sending HTML directly from the server can still
be faster, as there is no need for the browser to load and process
JavaScript in order to display some content.</p>
<p>So now Morepath has now, at last, gained server template support, in
version 0.10. We took our time. We prototyped a bit first. We worked
out the details of the rest of the framework. As we will see, it's
nice we had the chance to spend time on other aspects of Morepath
first, as that infrastructure now also makes template language
integration very clean.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-basics">
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>Say you want to use <a class="reference external" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja2</a>, the template language used by Flask, in
Morepath. Morepath does not ship with Jinja2 or any other template
language by default. Instead you can install it as a plugin in your
own project. The first thing you do is modify your project's
<tt class="docutils literal">setup.py</tt> and add <tt class="docutils literal">more.jinja2</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">install_requires</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">install_requires=[
  'more.jinja2',
],
</pre>
<p>Now when you install your project's dependencies, it pulls in
<a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/more.jinja2">more.jinja2</a>, which also pulls in the Jinja2 template engine
itself.</p>
<p>Morepath's extension system works through subclassing. If you want
Jinja2 support in your Morepath application, you need to subclass your
Morepath app from the <tt class="docutils literal">Jinja2App</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">from more.jinja2 import Jinja2App

class App(Jinja2App):
    pass
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">App</tt> class is now aware of Jinja2 templates.</p>
<p>Next you need to tell your app what directory to look in for templates:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">@App.template_directory()
def get_template_directory():
    return 'templates'
</pre>
<p>This tells your app to look in the <tt class="docutils literal">templates</tt> directory next to the
Python module you wrote this code in, so the <tt class="docutils literal">templates</tt>
subdirectory of the Python package that contains your code.</p>
<p>Now you can use templates in your code. Here's a HTML view with a
template:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">@App.html(model=Customer, template='customer.jinja2')
def customer_default(self, request):
    return {
      'name': self.name,
      'street': self.street,
      'city': self.city,
      'zip': self.zip_code
    }
</pre>
<p>The view returns a dictionary. This dictionary contains the variables
that should go into the <tt class="docutils literal">customer.jinja2</tt> template, which should be
in the <tt class="docutils literal">templates</tt> directory. Note that you have to use the
<tt class="docutils literal">jinja2</tt> extension, as Morepath recognizes how to interpret a
template by its extension.</p>
<p>You can now write the <tt class="docutils literal">customer.jinja2</tt> template that uses this
information:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Customer {{name}} lives on {{street}} in {{city}}.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The zip code is {{zip}}.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>You can use the usual <a class="reference external" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja2</a> constructs here.</p>
<p>When you access the view above, the template gets rendered.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chameleon">
<h2>Chameleon</h2>
<p>What if you want to use <a class="reference external" href="https://chameleon.readthedocs.org/">Chameleon</a> (ZPT) templates instead of Jinja2
templates? We've provided <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/more.chameleon">more.chameleon</a> that has this integration.
Include it in <tt class="docutils literal">install_requires</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal">setup.py</tt>, and then do this
to integrate it into your app:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">from more.chameleon import ChameleonApp

class App(ChameleonApp):
    pass
</pre>
<p>You can now set up a template directory and put in <tt class="docutils literal">.pt</tt> files,
which you can then refer to from the <tt class="docutils literal">template</tt> argument to views.</p>
<p>You could even subclass both <tt class="docutils literal">ChameleonApp</tt> <em>and</em> <tt class="docutils literal">Jinja2App</tt> apps
and have an application that uses both Chameleon and Jinja2
templates. While that doesn't seem like a great idea, Morepath does
allow multiple applications to be <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/app_reuse.html#nesting-applications">composed</a> into a larger application,
so it is nice that it is possible to combine an application that uses
Jinja2 with another one that uses Chameleon.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overrides">
<h2>Overrides</h2>
<p>Imagine there is an application developed by a third party that has a
whole bunch of templates in them. Now without changing that
application directory you want to override a template in it. Perhaps
you want to override a master template that sets up a common look and
feel, for instance.</p>
<p>In Morepath, template overrides can be done by subclassing the
application (just like you can override anything else):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">class SubApp(App):
    pass

@SubApp.template_directory()
def get_template_directory_override():
    return 'override_templates'
</pre>
<p>That <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#morepath.App.template_directory">template_directory</a> directive tells <tt class="docutils literal">SubApp</tt> to look for
templates in <tt class="docutils literal">override_templates</tt> first before it checks the
<tt class="docutils literal">templates</tt> directory that was set up by <tt class="docutils literal">App</tt>.</p>
<p>If we want to override <tt class="docutils literal">master.jinja2</tt>, all we have to do is copy it
from <tt class="docutils literal">templates</tt> into <tt class="docutils literal">override_templates</tt> and change it to suit
our purposes. Since a template with that name is found in
<tt class="docutils literal">override_templates</tt> first, it is found instead of the one in
<tt class="docutils literal">templates</tt>. The original <tt class="docutils literal">App</tt> remains unaffected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation">
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>In the introduction we mentioned that the template language
integration code into Morepath is clean. You should be able to
integrate other template engines easily too. Here is the code that
integrates Jinja2 into Morepath:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">import os
import morepath
import jinja2


class Jinja2App(morepath.App):
    pass


@Jinja2App.setting_section(section='jinja2')
def get_setting_section():
    return {
        'auto_reload': False,
    }


@Jinja2App.template_loader(extension='.jinja2')
def get_jinja2_loader(template_directories, settings):
    config = settings.jinja2.__dict__.copy()

    # we always want to use autoescape as this is about
    # HTML templating
    config.update({
        'autoescape': True,
        'extensions': ['jinja2.ext.autoescape']
    })

    return jinja2.Environment(
      loader=jinja2.FileSystemLoader(template_directories),
      **config)


@Jinja2App.template_render(extension='.jinja2')
def get_jinja2_render(loader, name, original_render):
    template = loader.get_template(name)

    def render(content, request):
        variables = {'request': request}
        variables.update(content)
        return original_render(template.render(**variables), request)
    return render
</pre>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#morepath.App.template_loader">template_loader</a> directive sets up an object that knows how to
load templates from a given list of template directories. In the case
of Jinja2 that is the Jinja2 environment object.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#morepath.App.template_render">template_render</a> directive then tells Morepath how to render
individual templates: get them from the loader first, and then
construct a function that given <tt class="docutils literal">content</tt> returned by the view
function and <tt class="docutils literal">request</tt>, uses the template to render it.</p>

<h3><a href="http://cosent.nl/en/blog" title="Cosent Plone Blog">Cosent</a></h3>


<div class="entrygroup" id="http://cosent.nl/en/blog/plone-intranet-munchen-sprint">
<h4><a href="http://cosent.nl/en/blog/plone-intranet-munchen-sprint">Plone Intranet München sprint report</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>The Plone Intranet project represents a major investment by the companies that together
form the Plone Intranet Consortium. Last week we gathered in München and worked really
hard to push the Mercury milestone we're working on close to an initial release.</p>
<p>Mercury is a complex project, challenging participants out of their comfort zones
in multiple ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Developers from 6 different countries are collaborating remotely,
across language barriers and time zones.</li>
<li>People are collaborating not within their "own" home team but across company
boundaries, with people whom they haven't really collaborated with before,
and who have not only a different cultural background but also a different
"company coding culture" background.</li>
<li>The backend architecture is unlike any stack peope are used to work with.
Instead of "normal" content types, you're dealing with async and BTrees.</li>
<li>The frontend architecture represents a paradigm shift as well, requiring
a significant change in developer attitude and practices. Many developers are
used to work from the backend forward; we are turning that on it's head.
The design is leading and the development flow is from frontend to backend.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we have a fragmented team tackling a highly challenging project.
The main goal we chose for the sprint therefore, was not to only produce code
but more importantly to improve team dynamics and increase development velocity.</p>
<p>Monday we started with getting everybody's development environments updated.
Also, Cornelis provided a walkthrough of how our Patternslib-based frontend
works.
Tuesday the marketing team worked hard on positioning and communications,
while the developer teams focused on finishing open work from the previous sprint.
As planned, we used the opportunity to practice the Scrum process in the full team
to maximize the learning payoff for the way we collaborate.
Wednesday we continued with Scrum-driven development.
Wednesday afternoon, after the day's retrospective,
we had a team-wide disussion resulting in a big decision:
to merge all of our packages into a single repository and egg.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-big-merge">
<h3>The big merge</h3>
<p>Mercury consists of 20 different source code packages,
each of which had their own version control and their own build/test tooling.
This has some very painful downsides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As a developer you need to build 20 separate testing environments.
That's a lot of infrastructure work, not to mention a fiendishly Jenkins setup.</li>
<li>When working on a feature, you're either using a different environment than the
tests are run in, or you're using the test environment but are then unable to
see the integrated frontend results of your work.</li>
<li>Most user stories need code changes across multiple packages, resulting in
multiple pull requests that each depend on the other. Impossible to not break
your continuous integration testing that way.</li>
<li>We had no single environment where you could run every test in every package at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we had a fragmented code base which imposed a lot of infrastructure work overhead,
created a lot of confusion and cognitive overhead, actively discouraged adequate testing,
and actively encouraged counterproductive "backend-up" developer practices instead of fostering
a frontend-focused integrative effort.</p>
<p>Of course throwing everything into a big bucket has it's downsides as well, which is why
we discussed this for quite some time before taking our decision.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-re-use">
<h3>Code re-use</h3>
<p>The main consideration is code re-use and open source community dynamics.
Everybody loves to have well-defined, loosely coupled packages that they can
mix and match for their own projects. Creating a single "big black box" ploneintranet
product would appear to be a big step backward for code re-use.</p>
<p>However, the reality we're facing is that the idea of loosely coupled components
is not how the code actually behaves. Sure, our backend is loosely coupled.
But the frontend is a single highly integrated layer. We're building an integrated
web application, not a set of standalone plugins.</p>
<p>We've maintained the componentized approach as long as we could, and it has cost us.
A good example is plonesocial: different packages with well-defined loosely coupled
backend storages. But most of our work is in the frontend and requires you to
switch between at least 3 packages to make a single frontend change.</p>
<p>In addition, these packages are not really pluggable anymore in the way Plone devs are used to.
You need the ploneintranet frontend, you need the ploneintranet application,
to be able to deliver on any of it's parts. Keeping something like
plonesocial.activitystream availabe as a separately installable Plone plugin
is actively harmful in that it sets wrong expectations.
It's not independently re-usable as is, so it should not be advertised as such.</p>
<p>We see different strategies Plone integrators can use ploneintranet:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Light customization.</p>
<p>You take the full ploneintranet application and do some cosmetic overrides,
like changing the logo and colours of the visual skin.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Full customization.</p>
<p>You design and develop a new application. This starts with a new or heavily
customized frontend prototype, which you then also implement the backend for.
Technically you either fork and tweak ploneintranet, or you completely build
your own application from scratch, re-using the ploneintranet parts you want
to keep in the backend via library mode re-use, see below.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Library mode cherry-picking.</p>
<p>You have a different use case but would like to be able to leverage parts of
the ploneintranet backend for heavy lifting. Your application has a python
dependency on those parts of ploneintranet you want to re-use: via ZCML
and GenericSetup you only load the cherries you want to pick.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please keep in mind, that this situation is exactly the same for the companies who
are building ploneintranet. We have those same 3 options. In addition there's a
fourth option:</p>
<ol class="arabic" start="4">
<li><p class="first">Extension.</p>
<p>Your client needs features which are not currently in ploneintranet but
are actually generally useful good ideas. You hire the ploneintranet designer
to design these extensions, and work with the ploneintranet consortium
to develop the new features into the backend. You donate this whole effort
to ploneintranet; in return you get reduced maintenance cost and the opportunity
to re-use the ploneintranet application as a whole without having to do a full
customization.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You'll have to join the Plone Intranet Consortium in order to pursue this fourth strategy.
But again, there's no difference for current members: we had to join as well.</p>
<p>To make individual component re-use possible, we've maintained the package separation we already had -
ploneintranet may be one repository, one egg, but it contains as separate python packages
the various functional components: workspace, microblog, document preview, etc.
So we do not subscribe to JBOC: Just a Bunch of Code. We don't throw everything into
one big bucket but are actively investing in maintaining sane functional packages.</p>
<p>A variant of cherry-picking is, to factor out generically re-usable functionality
into a standalone collective product. This will generally only be viable for
backend-only, or at least frontend-light functionality, for the reasons discussed above.
A good example is collective.workspace: the ploneintranet.workspace implementation
is not a fork but an extension of collective.workspace. This connection enables us
to implement all ploneintranet specific functionality in ploneintranet.workspace,
but factor all general improvements out to the collective. That has already been
done and resulted in experimental.securityindexing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="current-status">
<h3>Current status</h3>
<p>On Thursday we announced a feature freeze on the whole stack,
worked hard to get all tests to green and then JC performed
the merge of all ploneintranet.* into the new ploneintranet consolidated repo.
Meanwhile Guido prepared the rename of plonesocial.* to ploneintranet.*.
On Friday we merged plonesocial into ploneintranet and spent the
rest of the day in hunting down all test regressions introduced by the merges.
Because we now have a single test runner across all packages that meant
we also identified and had to fix a number of test isolation problems
we hadn't seen before.</p>
<p>Friday 20:45 all tests were finally green on Jenkins!</p>
<p>We still have to update the documentation to reflect the new consolidated situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="results">
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>In terms of team building this sprint has been phenomenal.
We've been sprinting on ploneintranet for five months now, but this was the first
time we were physically co-located and that's really a completely different experience.
We already did a lot of pair programming remotely, but it's better if you are sitting next
to each other and are actually looking at the same screen. Moreover feeling the vibe in
the room is something you cannot replicate remotely. The explosion of energy and
excited talking after we decided to do the consolidation merge was awesome.</p>
<p>On top of that we now have a consolidated build, and I can already feel in my own
development the ease of mind from knowing that the fully integrated development
environment I'm working in is identical to what all my team members are using,
and is what Jenkins is testing. Instead of hunting for branches I can see all
ongoing work across the whole project by simply listing the ploneintranet branches.
Reviewing or rebasing branches is going to be so much more easier.</p>
<p>On top of all that we also made significant progress on difficult features like
the document previewing and complex AJAX injections in the social stream.</p>
<p>We started with a fragmented team, working on a fragmented code base.
We now have a cohesive team, working on a unified code base.
I look forward to demoing Mercury in Sorrento in a few weeks.</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>A customer had instantiated a portlet on its homepage. He then made several changes that got saved in version history.</p>
<p>Later, the add-on that provided the portlet was uninstalled from the site.</p>
<p>When saving that page, the user would obviously get a broken object error.</p>
<p>To fix this issue, it was necessary to both remove the broken portlet on the given page and to delete (purge) all CMFEditions versions of that page that were holding an instance of the broken portlet.</p>
<p>While the former was easy (just use manage portlets page to remove the portlet), the latter took me much more time.</p>
<p>I document how I did it for anyone that might need to do something similar.</p>
<p>Through <code>instance debug</code>, I was able to find which versions were broken with a loop like:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(my_page.version_id):
...     print i
...     portal_repository.isUpToDate(my_page, i)</pre>
<p>I purged the given versions with:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from Products.CMFEditions.utilities import dereference
&gt;&gt;&gt; dereference(my_page)
(&lt;ATDocument at /Plone/my_page&gt;, 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(77,15,-1):
...     portal_historiesstorage.purge(1, i, metadata={'sys_metadata': {'comment':'purge version with broken portlet'}}, countPurged=False)</pre>
<p>I also had to update the version_id before comitting:</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div><p>Happy new year everybody! Last year we've made a <em>lot</em> of progress on
the Morepath web framework for Python. It will go quite a lot further
in 2015 as well. Here are 10 reasons why you should check out
Morepath this year:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Knows about HTTP status codes</strong>. When you write a "Hello World"
application it does not matter that there are other status codes
besides <tt class="docutils literal">200 OK</tt>, but in real world applications you want your
application to know about <tt class="docutils literal">404 Not Found</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">405 Method Not
Allowed</tt>, and so on.</p>
<p>Morepath does not make you write write verbose and failure-prone
special cased code to handle status codes. Instead, <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/better-rest-with-morepath-08.html#what-about-http-status-codes">Morepath does
HTTP status codes correctly right away.</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Morepath makes hyperlinks to objects</strong>. In a typical routing web
framework, to make a URL, you need to remember the name of a route,
the parameters that go into the route, and how to get that
information from the object to which you are making the route. This
leads to duplicated code and hardcodes route names
everywhere. Since it does so little, it encourages you to skip it
entirely and write even more hardcoded URL generation code
everywhere.</p>
<p>Morepath makes it <em>easier</em> to do the right thing. <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/superpowers.html#link-with-ease">Morepath lets
you link to Python objects</a>. Morepath
also understands URL parameters can be part of URLs too, and can
create a link with them in there for you too.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Built-in permission system</strong>. Morepath does not leave something
as important as security entirely up to extensions. The core
framework knows that views can be guarded with permissions. Who has
what permission for what object is then up to you, and <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html">Morepath
lets you define permissions powerfully and succinctly.</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Compose applications</strong>. If you have a project application and a
wiki application, you can mount the wiki application into the
project applications. You can develop and test applications
independently, and then combine them later. These are true
coarse-grained components. This way, <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/building_large_applications.html">Morepath lets build large
applications out of smaller ones.</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>All views are reusable</strong>. Morepath does not have a separate
sub-framework to let you write more reusable and generic views than
the normal ones. Instead <em>any</em> view you create in Morepath is
already reusable. And remember - you don't have to hardcode route
names, which makes views more generic by default.</p>
<p>Views in Morepath are true fine-grained reusable components,
without extra work. <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/superpowers.html#generic-ui">Morepath gives you the tools to build a
generic UI</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/superpowers.html#composable-views">You
can reuse views with ease with Morepath.</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Subclass applications</strong>. Morepath does not have a separate
sub-framework to let you write reusable blueprints for
applications. Instead, <em>any</em> application you create in Morepath is
already reusable in that way. In the real world, applications
evolve into frameworks all the time, and Morepath does not stand in
your way with special cases.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/app_reuse.html">You can subclass any Morepath app to add new routes and views, or
override existing
ones.</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Made for the modern web</strong>. Many modern web applications feature a
REST backend with a rich, client-side frontend written in
JavaScript. <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/rest.html">Morepath is written to support REST from the ground up</a> - it's not
a layer over something else, but it's not a constraining HTTP API
generation tool either.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Extensible framework</strong>. Morepath lets you extend the web
framework in the same way it lets you extend applications written
in it. You can write new Morepath directives and framework
applications. As examples, <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/more.static.html">more.static</a> adds
advanced browser static resource handling to Morepath,
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/more.transaction">more.transaction</a>
integrates Morepath with transaction based databases such as
SQLAlchemy and the ZODB, and <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/more.forwarded/">more.forwarded</a> adds HTTP
Forwarded header support.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Micro framework with macro ambitions</strong>. Morepath is a micro
framework; it's not a lot of code. It's easy to get an overview of
what's going on, and it's easy to embed in a larger
application. <strong>Morepath packs a lot more punch in a small amount of
code than your typical Python micro web framework</strong>.</p>
<p>All this does not come at the cost of performance. <strong>When the
primary selling point of a Python web framework seems to be
performance, perhaps it's not doing enough for you.</strong> But Morepath
has more than adequate performance - <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/better-rest-with-morepath-08.html#faster">on "Hello world" at least
Morepath outpaces some very popular web Python frameworks comfortably</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Documentation</strong>. Some Python micro frameworks also have micro
documentation. Instead, <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org">Morepath has lots of docs</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy 2015!</p></div></div>

<h4><a href="https://www.fourdigits.nl/blog/using-a-webfont-to-display-icons">Using a webfont to display icons</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<h2>Creating the vector images</h2>
<p>The vector images you need for the webfont need to be in the svg format. You can use your favorite editor to create or edit them, I'm using Adobe Illustrator in this example.</p>
<p><img alt="Creating svg file for webfonts" class="image-inline" src="https://www.fourdigits.nl/images/creating-svg-files-for-webfonts.jpg" title="Creating svg file for webfonts" /></p>
<p class=" ">There is only one thing important when creating the svg files and that is the creation of the <span>“</span>Artboard<span>”</span>. The “Artboard” should be exactly 512x512pt. If your image is not square the “Artboard” should still be 512x512pt. After you set the “Artboard” you scale your image to match the height of the “Artboard” and place the image all the way to the left. If some part of your image falls of (like in the example above) or if you have extra space left on the right that is not a problem. Save the file with a lowercase filename without spaces, for example “services.svg”.</p>
<h2>Installing grunt and grunt-webfont</h2>
<p>The easiest way to install grunt and grunt-webfont is to create a package.json file in your theme product. This file defines all the dependencies and can be used to install those. Here is the package.json file I used:</p>
<pre>{
    "name": "fourdigits.theme",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "description": "Four Digits Theme",
    "author": "Four Digits",
    "contributors": [{
        "name": "Four Digits",
        "email": "support@fourdigits.nl"
    }],
    "dependencies": {
        "grunt": "~0.4.5",
        "grunt-contrib-less": "~0.11.0",
        "grunt-contrib-watch": "~0.6.1",
        "grunt-contrib-uglify": "~0.6.0",
        "grunt-webfont": "~0.4.8"
    },
    "licenses" : [
        {
            "type" : "GPLv3",
            "url" : "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html"
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
<p class=" ">This file should be in the root of your theme package. When the file is created you can install the packages by running:</p>
<pre class=" ">npm install</pre>
<h2>Setting up the Grunt configuration</h2>
<p>The Grunt configuration is stored in the Gruntfile.js which should also be in the root of you theme package. The configuration I used is the following:</p>
<pre>module.exports = function(grunt) {
  grunt.initConfig({
    webfont: {
      icons: {
        src: 'fourdigits/theme/static/icons/*.svg',
        dest: 'fourdigits/theme/static/fonts',
        destCss: 'fourdigits/theme/static/stylesheets',
        options: {
          font: "icons",
          hashes: false,
          syntax: "bootstrap",
          stylesheet: "less",
          relativeFontPath: "/++theme++fourdigits.theme/fonts",
          htmlDemo: false
        }
      }
    }
  });

  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-webfont');
<br />  grunt.registerTask('default', ['webfont']);
};
</pre>
<p>The <span>“src<span>” should contain the location where all your svg images are stored which you created earlier. The “dest” should contain the location of the destination folder for your font. The “destCss” should contain the location of the destination of your stylesheets. The “font” option specifies the name of the font. The “stylesheet” setting specifies which format of stylesheet you want to use, we use less. The “relativeFontPath” should be used to specify the path of the fonts in your website.</span></span></p>
<h2>Generate the font and less file</h2>
<p>To generate the font and the less file you simply run the following command:</p>
<pre>grunt</pre>
<p>The output should be something like:</p>
<pre>Running "webfont:icons" (webfont) task
Font icons with 22 glyphs created.

Done, without errors.</pre>
<p class=" ">In the fonts folder the fonts are created in multiple formats. The files generated are:</p>
<pre class=" ">icons.eot<br />icons.svg<br />icons.ttf<br />icons.woff </pre>
<p class=" ">In the stylesheets folder a icons.less file is generated which can be included in your theme or compiled into a css file.</p>
<h2>Using the icons</h2>
<p>Using the icons from the webfont is really easy. To display an icons simply use the name of the svg file in the classname. For example if your svg icon has the name <span>“</span>services<span>”, the markup should look like this:</span></p>
<pre><span>&lt;span class="icon icon-services"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span></pre>
<p><span>Since it is a font you can set the color and the size using css, for example:</span></p>
<pre><span>.icon-services {<br /> color: <span>#2d9abc;<br /> font-size: 46px;<br />} </span></span></pre>
<h2>Final thought</h2>
<p>Using a webfont for your icons has a lot of advantages; the images are fully scalable so they look great on retina devices and you save a lot of bandwidth because the webfont file is a lot smaller than individual images. This solution also works crossbrowser (yes, even IE6 ;)).</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>A few weeks ago, I got mad for the xth times because my CI pipeline got broken again by <code>zc.buildout</code> <code>bootstrap</code> installing a version of <code>setuptools</code> that is incompatible with other parts of the pipeline.</p>
<p>With a few lines of code, I got a fix for this issue.</p>
<p>You can now find on <a class="external-link" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildout/buildout/master/bootstrap/bootstrap.py">github</a> master branch a version of <code>bootstrap.py</code> that accepts the <code>--setuptools-version</code> parameter.</p>
<p>To control finely which versions of packages are actually installed at bootstrap time, you can now use something like : </p>
<pre>python bootstrap.py --setuptools-version=7.0 --version=2.2.5</pre>
<p>This might be useful for those bitten by setuptools 8.0 and that cannot wait until all bugs are sorted out.</p>
<p>Enjoy,</p></div>

<p>
At the  <a href="http://2014.ploneconf.org">Plone Conference 2014</a> in Bristol, Guido Stevens presented the Plone Intranet Consortium
to an audience of Plone core developers. The presentation focused on the need for a new business
model for open source development, and the specific traction we're achieving within the Consortium already.
</p>

 <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/110489988">Plone Conference 2014 - The Plone Intranet Consortium</a></p>

<p>The "spare time" model of doing open source is broken. We need a better model.
In the Plone Intranet Consortium, a dozen Plone companies are jointly investing in
the creation of a high-quality out-of-the-box open source intranet platform based on Plone.
What is different is not just the funding model, but also the design-first approach we're taking.
</p>

<p>Slides of the presentation are available on SlideShare:</p>

<p>The Consortium is now working on creating the alpha release, codename: Mercury, which is scheduled early 2015.
We'll inform a wider audience via a website and a series of workshops, in the run-up to the Mercury release. Stay tuned!

<p>The <a class="external-link" href="http://2014.ploneconf.org/">PloneConf</a> is a worldwide event held once a year, where Plone stakeholders meet.</p>
<p>We arrived in Bristol on Tuesday evening. After checking into our appartments, we went into town for a bite and a drink. Bristol is a lively city, even on a weekday. We soon ran into other Plonistas who had already been doing training and <a class="external-link" href="https://plone.org/events/sprints">sprinting</a>. It is great to see all these people again.</p>
<p>Wednesday was the first conference day. It was a long day, from 9 to 6, packed with talks. Rob did a presentation on the new resource registries story in Plone 5 (with Ramon Navarro Bosch). The list of talks is on <a class="external-link" href="http://2014.ploneconf.org/talks">ploneconf.org/talks</a>, and the organisers are doing an excellent job to put these up on <a class="external-link" href="http://vimeo.com/channels/ploneconf2014/videos">Vimeo</a> almost real-time, so it's possible to follow all of it from home. Possible, but not easy! And then, there were Lightning Talks, which is a great way to learn from each other. We announced our <a class="external-link" href="https://plone.org/events/community/anniversary-sprint-2015">Anniversary Sprint</a>. We were all rather worn out at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Thursday also featured lots of talks. Maarten did a presentation on the <a class="external-link" href="http://vriendinnenonline.nl">vriendinnenonline.nl</a> portal which he built with his partner. Always during lunch and coffee breaks, we discussed Plone-related matters with other Plone people from around the globe, good conversations and new insights are bound to ensue. Thursday ended with the traditional PloneConf dinner and party.</p>
<p>Friday was reserved for Open Spaces, where people sit down in smaller groups to discuss things like training, documentation, the roadmap, running Plone in the cloud, the intranet effort, and so on. This is where we come together to find the common ground on which we base our collaboration, which will be mostly remote. It's so valuable to be able to talk to each other and discuss things, it makes communicating remotely later so much easier.</p>
<p>Saturday and Sunday, we sprint. A lot of topics have already been announced, most of them connected to presentations and Open Spaces. We'll see what the weekend brings.</p></div>

<p>Na een korte pauze vertelden Bonne Postma en Rob Kerkhoff (<a class="external-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/BaboCoffee">Babo Koffie</a>) over de herkomst van koffie, en lieten ze ons een paar bijzondere drankjes proeven. Mirna van der Veen (<a class="external-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/fairtravelers">IFO Fair Travelers</a>) legde uit wat ze wil bereiken met Fair Travelers, en wat daarbij komt kijken. Tenslotte kondigde Rob Gietema (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.fourdigits.nl/">Four Digits</a>) een <a class="external-link" href="http://arnhemhackathon.nl/">Hackathon</a> aan die dit weekend plaatsvond.</p>

<h4><a href="http://cosent.nl/en/blog/social-intranet-sprint-berlin">Social intranet sprint Berlin</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>The Plone social intranet sprint in Berlin at the Humboldt University was attended to by about 16 participants across two tracks, plus a social program in the evenings. Apart from all the hard work we also had a lot of fun. Berlin is a vibrant city and the Ploners who are also Berliners took us to some great restaurants.</p>
<div class="section" id="strategy-track">
<h3>strategy track</h3>
<p>The strategy track saw enthousiastic responses to a plan for joint investment by ~10 Plone companies into a new Plone intranet software suite. We'll use the coming weeks to solidify the momentum for this initiative and try and convert positive intentions into hard investment commitments.</p>
<p>A key part of the proposed plan is a design-first process to create a compelling user experience, leveraging Plone5-compatible frontend technologies. Netsight, Cosent and Syslab have already made an exploratory first iteration with this design process, focussed on re-designing the microblogging and social activity stream interactions in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cosent/plonesocial.suite">Plonesocial</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coding-track">
<h3>coding track</h3>
<p>In the coding track, we've taken these new frontend designs and implemented them on top of the existing Plonesocial code base. The result is, that we now have a <a class="reference external" href="http://patternslib.com/">Patternslib</a> based Plonesocial implementation that can be installed and run in a Plone 4 installation. Because Plone5 <a class="reference external" href="http://plone.github.io/mockup/dev/">Mockup</a> is also Patternslib-based, the work we're doing is forward compatible and will be easily portable to Plone 5.</p>
<p>In addition to implementing the existing Plonesocial features, the sprint also resulted in the integration of plonesocial.messaging (private one-on-one messages) and new "reply" functionality (conversation threading).</p>
<p>The new frontend introduces a host of new features that are not yet provided by the backend and need to be architected and coded: file uploads, URL and file previews, "@mentions", "liking", "favoriting" etc. Also, we're already working on extending the design with a number of subtle but powerful micro-interactions in the form of shortcodes to provide a pluggable linking system.</p>
<p>The current development version of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cosent/plonesocial.suite">Plonesocial</a> is more advanced than the last released version, but it needs more work before we can make a production-quality release - so come and join us in the next sprint at <a class="reference external" href="http://2014.ploneconf.org">Plone Conference 2014</a> in Bristol.</p>

<p>While many people are still enjoying the beach, we're already gearing up to accelerate design and development
for Plone Intranet this fall.</p>
<p>Following the Mosaic sprint and a ploneintranet summit in Gatwick we're now
collaborating with with <a class="reference external" href="http://syslab.com">Syslab</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://cornae.com">Cornelis Kolbach</a>.
to turn wireframes and high-fidelity designs of social interactions
into HTML/CSS/Javascript prototypes,
using <a class="reference external" href="http://patternslib.com">Patternslib</a> (similar to <a class="reference external" href="http://plone.github.io/mockup/dev/">Mockup</a>).</p>
<p>This is a screenshot of some of the frontend work in progress:</p>
<img alt="social interaction prototype" src="http://cosent.nl/images/socialwidget_20140731_2.png" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>We'll extend this work in the run-up to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.coactivate.org/projects/berlin-plone-sprint-2014/project-home">Berlin sprint</a> in September,
which will be focussed on extending <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cosent/plonesocial.suite">plonesocial</a> and integrating it with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ploneintranet">ploneintranet</a>.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide a workable code base, that documents much of the design
decisions we're making in a way that enables community collaboration.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ploneintranet">The backend code</a> we're working on is already open and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.netsight.co.uk/blog/plone-intranet-development-sprint-update-july-2014">published</a>:

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Recently we moved a site from a long-time customer to Plone 4.3.</p>
<p>First off, the list of step to follow in <a class="external-link" href="http://plone.org/documentation/manual/upgrade-guide/version/">http://plone.org/documentation/manual/upgrade-guide/version/</a> were quite exhaustive. There were some things that we did differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>We went straight from Plone 3.3 to 4.3.3, skipping the intermediate versions (4.0, 4.1 and 4.2). For our site this worked.</li>
<li>After that, we ran all upgrade steps at once.</li>
<li>We had to manually remove some Javascripts (mostly Kupu) from the registry, in order for TinyMCE to work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sooner you upgrade to a more recent stable version, the smaller the hassle. Also, there’s a performance improvement (see image), and some nice new features.

<h4><a href="http://cosent.nl/en/blog/plog2014">Plone Open Garden 2014</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>This year's edition was no exception. More than 50 Plonistas, wives and kids (and even one mother-in-law) included,
gathered to renew friendships, lounge in the sun, discuss arcane technologies after midnight,
and generally have a great time together. Oh we also had technical presentations every morning.</p>
<img alt="PLOG 2014 group picture" src="http://cosent.nl/images/plog2014.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>We talked about intranets and ways in which we can jointly strengthen Plone as an intranet platform.
Netsight and Cosent outlined their research and development timeline for the coming year
and worked with other Plone companies to maximize community involvement.</p>
<p>A recurring topic this year was the question, how we can modernize the page layout engine for Plone.
We already have a lot of machinery to manage layouts in the form of portlets, portlet managers, viewlets and
METAL macros. In addition we have the newer blocks and tiles to further complicate the picture.
The discussion oscillated between:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Let's stick with portlets. They are a proven, powerful and widely used technology.</li>
<li>The portlets machinery is wickedly complex and too burdensome.</li>
<li>The content + slots + portlets page model is overconstrained, a responsive grid renderer would be better.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being technologists, we did not spend much energy on the first two points which are mostly about opinion.
Rather, we focused on the last point which presents technical challenges.
The gist of what we discussed can maybe best be expressed by a story:</p>
<blockquote>
A editor opens a page. On the "display" menu she chooses "create new layout". A <a class="reference external" href="http://quick.as/xrn4tleo">layout editor</a> opens and lets her place and arrange tiles on the page. For each tile, she defines a policy of when (context, view, ...) and where (priority, position hint) to show this tile. For the layout as a whole, she defines a policy where this layout should be used (context, type, subtree, ...). She checks previews of the layout for various display media (desktop, tablet, mobile), tunes some tile placements and then applies the layout.</blockquote>
<p>This is just one possible scenario and it will likely change. To explore the possibilities
we will get together in Barcelona in the second week of June and sprint to create a proof of concept.</p></div>

<h4><a href="http://cosent.nl/en/blog/designing-open-source-social-intranet">Designing an open source social intranet</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://netsight.co.uk">Netsight</a> have invited Cosent to collaborate on designing
a complete social intranet software suite, to be developed
in collaboration with the open source <a class="reference external" href="http://plone.org">Plone</a> community.</p>
<p>A "Plone Intranet" summit in the wake of the 2013 Plone conference
listed <em>user experience</em>, that is: design, as the single most important challenge
to tackle if we want to strengthen Plone's attractiveness for
the intranet market.</p>
<p>As everybody knows, design is not a problem one solves in a committee.
We're using a hybrid model of <a class="reference external" href="http://hbr.org/2008/12/which-kind-of-collaboration-is-right-for-you/ar/1">collaboration styles</a> that allows us
to combine the design strengths of a core team with the scaling capabilities
of an open source community.</p>
<p>The plan is to donate the work we've been doing to the Plone community,
so come and join us at the <a class="reference external" href="http://abstract-technology.com/plog-event-plone-italy">Plone Open Garden 2014</a> in Sorrento to <a class="reference external" href="https://trello.com/c/1goE2BMv/22-guido-stevens-plone-intranet">get involved</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="so-what-have-we-been-up-to">
<h3>So, what have we been up to?</h3>
<p>Last winter Cosent published the <a class="reference external" href="http://cosent.nl/roadmap">Digital Workplace Technology Roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>Following up on that, we've been analysing the competition, both
in terms of the user experience their platforms offer but also
in the kind of problems they solve, i.e. what markets they're in.
We see significant market potential for a Plone-based solution.</p>
<p>Additionally, we've analysed dozens of cases studies of award-winning intranet
designs and have clustered hundreds of intranet screenshots to understand
common functional areas, or landing pages, in intranets, mapping those against the model
provided by the Digital Workspace Technology Roadmap.</p>
<p>Last week, Netsight and Cosent have been sprinting to turn the insights gained
from all of that
into actionable designs, that can be used to guide software development.</p>
<p>We selected three types of landing pages in intranets for deeper investigation.
For each of these pages, we brainstormed specific <em>functions</em> that users would want to use
and card-sorted those into <em>families</em> of similar functionality.</p>
<img alt="Matt and Lewis at the whiteboard" src="http://cosent.nl/images/netsight-march-2014.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 461px;" />
<p>We then picked a single landing page to work on and created several <em>epics</em> with short
scenarios about a typical sequence of actions a user would execute to obtain a
specific outcome. For example, one of our epics is:</p>
<blockquote>
(Team Member) Wendy receives an email from Peter with a list of questions and data that need to be collated before the next meeting of the project board. She forwards the mail into the intranet, where she flags it as a todo for next week on Project X, tags it as "board meeting", adding a note with some initial ideas and could @marcella maybe share her thoughts on this?</blockquote>
<p>For each <em>epic</em>, we created a diagram that sequenced every <em>function</em> invoked as part of
the scenario, and then expanded each function step into a full-fledged <em>user story</em>. For example,
one of the steps halfway the above epic is the following user story:</p>
<blockquote>
Team Member can mention other Team Members in the note (using '@' syntax).</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="don-t-shuffle-the-stack">
<h3>Don't shuffle the stack</h3>
<p>Fleshing out those user stories was a lot of work, and involved detailed discussions
about our assumptions and choices regarding security architecture and overall strategy.
This was done by part of the team, while the other half worked on wireframing possible
solutions for the epic. That was a bad idea. They had the same discussions, with different
conclusions.</p>
<img alt="elements of user experience" src="http://cosent.nl/images/elements-of-user-experience-j_j_-garrett.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 394px;" />
<p>Moving from epic to wireframing involves jumping a level up the design stack in
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321683684/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0321683684&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=cosent-21">Garrett</a> five-level model of the design process.
When we brought the finished user stories together with the wireframe sketches we had
some major inconsistencies. This appears to confirm the model and indicate that you
need to get your foundations right before moving to more concrete designs.
In this case, you really need to define your scope in detail, before wireframing solutions.</p>
<p>After re-syncing our minds and merging our work, in the final day we ventured
into wireframing territory not for a whole page, but for exploring a set of micro-interactions
that form the core of a cohesive social intranet experience.
We also deepened our understanding of user needs and elaborated
on the personas we're using to drive the design.</p>
<p>All in all, we feel we have not only made significant progress towards valuable design outcomes,
but also have prototyped a repeatable design process that tackles very complex design challenges in a systematic way.</p>
<p>We plan to have another design sprint in a few weeks to prepare for Sorrento, and look forward to sharing our work there.
See you in lovely Italy!</p>

<h4><a href="http://cosent.nl/en/blog/monkey-patching-good-bad-ugly">Monkey patching: the good, the bad and the ugly</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>This is a highly technical article, intended for a technical audience.
You should probably skip it if you're not a software developer.</p>
<p>I just had a bad news conversation with a client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Your website is doomed. It cannot be upgraded.
It cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>All your content is fatally compromised,
as if a computer virus had attacked your site.</p>
<p>The only remedy is to make a fresh copy of the software
and start from scratch with a clean database.
The hundreds of pages in your site will have to be re-entered manually."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was not pleased. I was surprised he didn't cancel my contract, right there and then.
Luckily for me, I am not the author of the original website:
this disastrous outcome was not my doing.</p>
<p>The whole affair did lead me to reflect on the question,
whether this could have happened to me, in one of my own projects?
How resilient are my own coding practices against the kind of extreme
outcomes I just witnessed? Hence, this article.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-good">
<h3>The Good</h3>
<p>As you will have guessed from the title of this article, we're talking about <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patching</a>:
the practice of modifying a system's behavior by changing its code base run-time.</p>
<p>The Good is, that as an integrator working with a software framework like Plone,
you do this all the time without even thinking of it as monkey patching.
Registering an adapter with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.muthukadan.net/docs/zca.html">Component Architecture</a> is the canonical way
of customizing the system's behavior, and involves getting your code called
<em>instead</em> of the code that normally would be called at that interface point.
Customizing a view template is just a light-weight variant of the adapter pattern.
It's perfectly normal and accepted. This is what ZCML is for.
It's expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-bad">
<h3>The Bad</h3>
<p>To paraphrase Cruijff: <em>"every upside has its downside"</em>.</p>
<p>The Bad is, that there's a thin line between customizing a framework as intended,
and messing around with collateral damage, i.e. monkeying around.</p>
<p>What if the behavior you want to customize is not componentized in a way that makes
it easy to overlay your custom code over its implementation?
Monkey patch to the rescue:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">import some.framework.goodie

def my_monkeypatched_search(context, query):
    # do something smart
    return

original_search = some.framework.goodie.search
some.framework.goodie.search = my_monkeypatched_search
</pre>
<p>And hey presto! Every call to <tt class="docutils literal">some.framework.goodie.search</tt> now gets dispatched
via <tt class="docutils literal">my_monkeypatched_search</tt> instead.</p>
<p>There's a price to pay for this, though:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It becomes very difficult to debug the call flow.
You just performed a man-in-the-middle attack against all <em>other</em> consumers
of the framework function you monkeyed.</li>
<li>You introduce a tight coupling between the framework implementation and your monkey patch.
Meaning that when the framework changes, your monkey patch has to be upgraded in sync.
That's a nicely hidden, undocumented maintenance problem you just created.</li>
<li>Other modules may be trying to override the same original framework function.
Which means you have a race condition with two (or more) parties warring to get their monkey patch in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last issue is the source of the term monkey patch:
you have <em>guerrilla</em> patches fighting it out. Guerilla, gorilla, get it? Monkey patches.</p>
<p>To illustrate how thin the line is: the tight coupling maintenance problem also occurs if you do
a simple template override via <tt class="docutils literal">z3c.jbot</tt>. Unless you plan ahead and check
the <em>unchanged</em> upstream template into your customization package <em>first</em>,
with a commit message specifying the upstream location,
you'll find it very hard in two years time to port your 5-line template change,
which you didn't document and don't remember,
into a 100-line template file with substantial upstream changes.</p>
<p>To further convolute matters we have <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.monkeypatcher">collective.monkeypatcher</a>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">&lt;monkey:patch
        description="This works around issue #xyz"
        class="Products.CMFPlone.CatalogTool.CatalogTool"
        original="searchResults"
        replacement=".catalog.patchedSearchResults"
        /&gt;
</pre>
<p>This mitigates the problem somewhat by resolving some sequencing issues when activating the patch.
And it dresses up in a greppable, nice ZCML suit with a tie, blurring the line between legitimate businesses
and the mob.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you shouldn't do this: I do it myself. Occasionally.
But you should be aware of the dangers. Which brings us to the last part,
and the reason I'm writing this piece.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-ugly">
<h3>The Ugly</h3>
<p>There's a thin line between customization and monkey patching.
And then there's a slippery slope between monkey patching and hacker hell,
greased with good intentions and hacker hero hubris.</p>
<p>The disaster I described in the introduction was the result of an add-on developer
realizing that not only the code base can be monkey patched.
You can monkey patch actual stored objects in the database, too! Yeah!</p>
<p>Please check your medication, if you think that's a neat idea.</p>
<p>These guys not only overrode every field in every content type in the code base.
With a coding style that pokes out your eye with pep8 violations.
They also changed the storage model for every field. On every content object in the database.
With a one-way migration from mainstream sanity to multiple f***edup disorder.</p>
<p>In my client's case, the add-on is poorly maintained and blocks a Plone upgrade.
Removing the add-on results in empty fields on all objects, and gibberish in the catalog.
Trying to reverse-engineer and revert the database hacks makes your head explode.</p>
<p>Code base monkey patches you can escape from: by removing the offending code from
your system. Just refactor away all dependencies and remove the stuff from your buildout.</p>
<p>However, anything that changes your database in a meaningful way, without a corresponding
uninstall, risks turning a nice project into a full-fledged nightmare.
After you've launched, and a change request opens up the can of worms.</p>
<p>Which raises some interesting questions, for me and for you:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How often do I/you write add-ons without providing and testing an uninstall profile?</li>
<li>How often do I/you install add-ons without auditing for irreversible installer changes?</li>
<li>How many of my/your projects depend on add-ons we don't fully understand?
Whose lead developer has, two years later, apparently moved on to greener pastures?</li>
</ul>
<p>On all these counts, I plead guilty as charged.
I have sinned and will better my ways.</p>
<p>How about you?</p>

<h4><a href="http://cosent.nl/en/blog/plonesocial-plog2013">PloneSocial PLOG2013 Sprint Report</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>
Plone Open Garden is a yearly mini-conference where Plone developers
come together in the beautiful ambiance of Sorrento. This year
about 50 people gathered under the palm trees to exchange knowledge
and collaborate on exciting technologies until late in the night.
</p>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>

<p>
The PloneSocial track started with a presentation by Guido Stevens
giving an overview of the PloneSocial project, and presenting
a vision and roadmap for realizing an open source digital workplace.
</p>

  <div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"> <strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GuidoStevens/plonesocial-roadmap" target="_blank" title="Plonesocial roadmap">Plonesocial roadmap</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GuidoStevens" target="_blank">Guido Stevens</a></strong> </div>
<p>
The vision outlined in the presentation above will also be published
as a whitepaper soon. Fill in your email address on the top right
of this page to sign up for the Cosent newsletter and receive a copy
of the Digital Workplace Technology Roadmap as soon as it's available.
</p>

<h3>Sprint Progress</h3>
<p>
Thomas Desvenain and Guido Stevens collaborated on integrating
collective.local.workspace
with PloneSocial. 
This will result in secure collaboration and discussion areas
for teams and communities, with per-workspace microblogging
and activitystreams.
</p>
<p>
Asko Soukka provided support in setting up Robot Framework
testing for PloneSocial. We now have a setup that provides
local browser testing, remote browser testing via Saucelabs,
and fully automated continous integration testing by
integrating Saucelabs with Travis-CI.
</p>
<p>
The cool part of this setup is, that it automatically generates
demo videos that shows how PloneSocial works from an end-user
perspective. Because the demo video generation is scripted,
it gets automatically updated for all the new features that we're
developing as soon as we do a Github commit.
</p>
<p>
Asko also has been working on "speech bubble notes" for such videos
to visualize clicks and annotate screen shots with text that explains
what's going on.
</p>

<h3>Follow up</h3>
<p>
As usual, the sprint results in a lot of promising work-in-progress
that requires more time to be finished and released. Some relevant
follow-ups you can expect to be released in the course of 2013:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Context-aware microblogging for local workspaces</li>
<li>Reference design for a fully social workspace</li>
<li>Functional test coverage and demo video for PloneSocial</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="entrygroup" id="http://bubblenet.be/blog/use-gdb-with-zope">
<h4><a href="http://bubblenet.be/blog/use-gdb-with-zope">Use gdb with Zope (or Python)</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Today, Jean-François Roche and I were debugging a spinning Zope instance.</p>
<p>We first tried to use Zope 2.13 signal handling feature.</p>
<p>When Zope catches a SIGUSR1 signal that is sent by issuing
<code>kill -10 myzope_pid</code>, Zope dumps the stack trace of each thread to stdout.<br />(For the record, if you work with Zope2 &lt; 2.13, you can install <a class="external-link" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.signalstack/">Products.signalstack</a> to get the same feature).</p>
<p>If you do not have access to stdout, for instance when running Zope in background, you can use <a class="external-link" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/five.z2monitor">five.z2monitor</a>. <br />Jean-François released it a few weeks ago. Its <a class="external-link" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/five.z2monitor">README</a> will tell you more. </p>
<p>Back to our problem.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, neither of the two solutions hereabove did help us : we did not get any strack trace.</p>
<p>This made us guess that we were stuck in a C extension : <br />when looping in C extension code, the Python interpreter has no chance to run registered signal handlers or to switch to other Python threads.</p>
<p>To find where we were looping, we would need to use <strong>gdb</strong> (that we had never used before).<br />We searched for <em>start zope with gdb</em> and found an old article on old.zope.org : <a class="external-link" href="http://old.zope.org/Members/4am/debugspinningzope">Debug a spinning Zope.</a></p>
<p>This article explain very well of to use <strong>gdb</strong> to debug this type of problem. It was very easy to follow step by step. Content is copied hereunder.<br />It allowed us to confirm that Zope was actually spinning in <code>re.search</code>, iow in a C extension.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Spinning" is when a request causes a running Zope to consume all 
available CPU indefinitely.  This is usually caused by some kind of 
infinite loop or deadlock, and is painful to debug.  Under Linux, at 
least, I've been able to use gdb to solve one spinning problem.</p>
<p>I've only tried this on a Mandrake 8.1 Linux installation, with a 
multi-threaded, zdaemoned Zope 2.5.1 running under Python 2.1.3.  I have
 no experience debugging any other configuration this way.</p>
<ol>
<li> Attach to Zope with the Gnu Debugger
<p>  <em>Don't know how to use gdb?  Neither do I, but I was able to muddle through.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Look in your <code>var/Z2.pid</code> file and get the second pid listed there.</li>
<li>Run gdb with the name of your python executable.  For example, with Python 2.1.3, I ran <code>gdb python2.1</code>.</li>
<li>At the <code>(gdb)</code> prompt, type <code>attach pid</code>, using the pid you found earlier.</li>
<li>If all goes well, you should have to page through several screens worth of "Reading symbols" spew.  Hit return until it's done.</li></ul>
</li>
<li> Find the spinning thread
<ul>
<li>Type <code>info threads</code> at the <code>(gdb)</code> prompt.</li>
<li>Unless your Zope is very busy, most of the threads should be in <code>sigsuspend()</code>, <code>poll()</code>, or <code>select()</code>.
<br />You should be able to spot the troublemaker here.<br />Failing that, check
<code>top</code>
for the pid of the thread that's using all the CPU time, and look for <code>(LWP)</code> in the thread list.</li>
<li>Supposing our culprit is listed as <code>4 Thread 2051 (LWP 8236) ...</code>,<br />we now switch to thread 4 with the command <code>thread 4</code>.</li></ul>
</li>
<li> Get a traceback
<p>  <em>Now for the fun part, thanks to <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/1999-June/006153.html">a post by Barry Warsaw</a>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Type the following at the prompt:
<pre>    call PyRun_SimpleString("import sys, traceback; sys.stderr=open('/tmp/tb','w',0); traceback.print_stack()")</pre>
</li>
<li>Look in <code>/tmp/tb</code> for a complete Python traceback of the current call stack of the thread.</li></ul>
</li>
<li> Figure out where the loop/deadlock is.
<p>I can't give step-by-step instructions on this one.  Try repeating step 3 several times; you should see a pattern.<br />In my case, the thread was always in the __read() method of an NMB connection, and I discovered that it was being called with no timeout value.</p>
</li></ol>
<hr />
<p>This was a chance to go back in the past and being recalled of famous Evan Simpson, one of the authors of the Zope book.</p>
<p>I also want to thank the people that keep <a class="external-link" href="http://old.zope.org">old.zope.org</a> running, giving us a chance to keep access to precious information like copied hereabove.</p></div>

<h4><a href="http://bubblenet.be/blog/lets-get-rid-of-z3c.autoinclude">Let's get rid of z3c.autoinclude</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I have been against the use of <code>z3c.autoinclude</code> since a long time.</p>
<p>The main reason I am against it is that it causes tests setup to be more painful.</p>
<p>Let's check the following scenario. There is a package named <code>clean_and_explicit</code>. That package depends on another package, named <code>nasty_and_implicit</code>, that relies on <code>z3c.autoinclude</code> to include its dependencies.</p>
<p>When setting up tests for <code>clean_and_explicit</code>, loading its own <code>configure.zcml</code> should be enough to ensure all ZCML dependencies are included.</p>
<p>Its <code>configure.zcml</code> should only include its direct dependencies :</p>
<pre>&lt;include package="nasty_an_implicit" /&gt;</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, because <code>nasty_and_implicit</code> relies on auto-inclusion of its ZCML dependencies, <code>clean_and_explicit</code> needs to explicitely include them in its <code>testing.zcml</code> :</p>
<pre>&lt;include package="nasty_and_implicit" /&gt;
&lt;include package="nasty_and_implicit_dependency_one" /&gt;
&lt;include package="nasty_and_implicit_dependency_two" /&gt;</pre>
<p>This is needed because <code>plone.app.testing</code> does not rely on <code>z3c.autoinclude</code> to load ZCML. This is a good design decision as <code>z3c.autoinclude</code> would load useless ZCML in a lot of cases.</p>
Further, the inclusion of those dependencies is really dirty : if later <code>nasty_and_implicit</code> does not need them anymore, <code>clean_and_explicit</code> will still refer to them.
<p> </p>
<p>Today, I have been bitten by another side effect of <code>z3c.autoinclude</code>.</p>
<p>I had made a release of a package that failed to include its ZCML files because of a broken <code>MANIFEST.in</code>.</p>
<p>Because the system I was working on relied on <code>z3c.autoinclude</code> to include my broken package ZCML, I got no warning that the <code>configure.zcml</code> file was missing : it was not explicitely loaded anywhere.</p>
<p>I lost the whole morning to find out that a <code>subscriber</code> was not registered as its registration through ZCML was not included anymore.</p>
<p>I really hope that this post will get support and that we will get rid of <code>z3c.autoinclude</code> in next Plone versions.</p></div>

<h4><a href="http://bubblenet.be/blog/plone-3-cleanup-left-over-interfaces">Plone 3 : cleanup left over interfaces</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>In Plone 3 sites, even when you uninstalled add-ons properly, interfaces were left over in persistent registries.</p>
<p>Before 3.5.2, <tt class="docutils literal">zope.interface</tt> was broken :
it did not remove keys when unregistering adapters or unsubscribing
subscribers.</p>
<p>This leads to nasty bugs when the code that defined those interfaces is removed
from the system.</p>
<p>The <a class="external-link" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cleanup_zope_persistent_registry">cleanup_zope_persistent_registry package</a> defines a function that cleans up those leftover interfaces.
It must be called on a site manager, instance of <tt class="docutils literal">PersistentComponents</tt>
like the local site manager of a Plone site:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">from zope.component import getSiteManager
from cleanup_zope_persistent_registry import cleanup_leftovers

site_manager = getsitemanager(my_plone_site)
cleanup_leftovers(site_manager)</pre>
<p>Enjoy</p></div>

<div class="content">
<h2>Let's call ourselves <em><strong>Community Shared Development</strong></em> !</h2>
<p> </p>
<div class="pullquote">This post is a follow up to Matt Hamilon's post <a class="external-link" href="http://www.netsight.co.uk/blog/have-the-vendor-open-source-companies-ruined-it-for-the-rest-of-us-and-if-so-what-do-we-call-ourselves-now/netsightblogentry_view#1292752238226048">Have the vendor open source companies ruined it for the rest of us and if so what do we call ourselves now?</a> and the various comments I have read there.</div>
<p>Who are we ? We are a community of individuals, business companies, public and non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>We collaborate and share the full development process of our system: functional and requirements analysis, coding and development, quality assurance, plus best practices for each of those.</p>
<p>This includes Open Source but goes further.</p>
<p class="discreet">Seven years ago,<em><strong> Community Shared Development</strong></em> is what made me choose <a class="external-link" href="http://plone.org">Plone community's CMS</a> instead of single-dominant-vendor Open Source Nuxeo CPS. Since then, it is also what I sell to my customers.</p>
<p>Why <em><strong>Community Shared Development</strong></em> instead of Open Development as proposed by Dylan Jay and others ?</p>
<p>The word Development is a real differentiator. But, if we keep the word Open, do we really differentiate from Open Source ? I think it does not trigger enough questions.</p>
<p>Also, Open Development misses the community aspect. While reading Matt's post, my first reaction was that that the term Community was missing. I read in the comments that at least Jens and Wouter also think it is an important term.</p>
<p>Further, we need to include a term that will be harder to hijack by single-dominant-vendor Open Source systems.</p>
<p>Like Wouter, while reading, I came to Open Business Community Development. But this has two drawbacks. First and main, it is too long.</p>
<p>Second, it uses the term Business. This might feel like excluding the contributions from individuals, public or non-profit organizations. Also, it is a term that might feel suspect to some members of our community.</p>
<p>I then came to Community Development... which felt nice at first thought. However, while trying to explain Community Development in the text above, I found out that the word Sharing came naturally. It is a good replacement for Open. Choosing a way of calling ourselves that does not include any terms found in Open Source will trigger questions and reactions.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to reading your questions and reactions !</p></div>

SUBJECT: ESTONIA'S CYBER ATTACKS: WORLD'S FIRST VIRTUAL 
ATTACK AGAINST NATION STATE 

REF: A) TALLINN 276 B) TALLINN 280 C) TALLINN 347 D) 
LEE-GOLDSTEIN EMAIL 05/11/07 

Classified By: Ambassador S. Dave Phillips for reasons 1.4 (b) &amp; (d) 

<a href="http://213.251.145.96/cable/2007/06/07TALLINN366.html#par1" id="par1">¶</a>1. (S) Summary. Since April 27, Estonia has been the 
victim of the world's first coordinated cyber attacks 
against a nation state and its political and economic 
infrastructure. The sensational nature of the story, 
combined with the highly technical details of the subject 
matter, has led to a good deal of misinformation in the 
public domain. Although GOE and international analysis 
is ongoing, these attacks have highlighted the 
vulnerability of both government and private sector 
internet infrastructure to attacks of this nature. For 
over a month, government, banking, media, and other 
Estonian websites, servers, and routers came under a 
barrage of cyber attacks. Defense against the attacks 
was extremely expensive for both GOE and the private 
sector. GOE and private cyber defense experts cite the 
nature and sophistication of the attacks as proof of 
Russian government complicity in the attacks. End 
Summary. 

Virtual Shots Heard Round the World 
----------------------------------- 

<a href="http://213.251.145.96/cable/2007/06/07TALLINN366.html#par2" id="par2">¶</a>2. (C) Cyber attacks against Estonian websites began on 
April 27. They came in the wake of rioting in Tallinn 
triggered by the Government of Estonia's (GOE) 
preparations for relocating the so called "Bronze 
Soldier", a Soviet-era World War II monument (Refs A and 
B). The attacks initially targeted GOE websites 
including those of the Estonian President, Prime 
Minister, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), Ministry of 
Justice (MOJ), and Parliament, among others. According 
to XXXXXXXXXXXX the initial attacks were 
technically unsophisticated and "seemed more like a cyber 
riot than a cyber war." However, all our Estonian 
interlocutors clearly recognized these attacks as 
political in nature. Russian-language internet chat 
forums held discussions exhorting people to attack 
Estonian sites and supplied downloadable software tools 
to carry out the attacks. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, these 
initial attacks were limited to spam (a barrage of 
unsolicited emails) and cyber vandalism (e.g., Prime 
Minister Andrus Ansip's photo was defaced on the Estonian 
Reform Party's website) and appeared to be nothing more 
than a virtual mob reaction to the Bronze Soldier issue. 
Estonian media and press commentators were quick to 
accuse Moscow of being responsible, interpreting these 
attacks as part of Russian retribution for moving the 
Bronze Soldier (Ref C). 

<a href="http://213.251.145.96/cable/2007/06/07TALLINN366.html#par3" id="par3">¶</a>3. (S) However, on April 30, a broader range of cyber 
attacks -- from simple spam postings to coordinated DDoS 
(Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks -- began against 
GOE sites. (Note. A DDoS attack is when a flood of 
bogus queries are made to a specific server or network of 
computers in order to over-saturate the target and 
prevent access by legitimate users. End Note.) For 
example, the Presidential website, which normally has a 2 
million Mbps (megabits per second) capacity, was flooded 
with nearly 200 million Mbps of traffic. While none of 
the technology involved in the attacks was new, tactics 
and tools routinely shifted to prevent Estonian 
authorities from blocking the attacks. One of the most 
pernicious tools in these attacks was "bots." (Note. 
Bots are computers and/or servers under the control of a 
third party. End Note.) These bot attacks came from 
ISPs (internet service providers) around the world (e.g., 
the United States, Canada, Russia, Turkey, Germany, 
Belgium, Egypt, Vietnam, etc.). Attacks routinely came 
from one set of bots, subsided and then resumed again 
using another set of bots with different ISPs. According 
to XXXXXXXXXXXX, the attacks ranged from a single
minute to  many hours in length. The longest attacks lasted


TALLINN 00000366 002 OF 004 


over  ten hours and unleashed a crushing 90 million Mbps of 
traffic on targeted endpoints. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX,
the GOE's  assessment was that a small but unknown number
of  individuals were behind these more sophisticated cyber 
attacks, which quickly dwarfed the traffic volume of the 
initial cyber rioters. 

<a href="http://213.251.145.96/cable/2007/06/07TALLINN366.html#par4" id="par4">¶</a>4. (S) On May 3, the cyber attacks expanded beyond GOE 
sites and servers to private sites. Hansabank and SEB, 
Estonia's two largest banks, faced the most significant 
problems. Swedish-owned Hansabank and SEB account for 
almost 75% of all online banking in Estonia. (Note: 
Approximately 90% of all money transfers and bill 
payments in Estonia are done online. End Note.) 
Hansabank was well prepared with powerful servers, 
alternate sites to mirror content (thus making it more 
difficult for DDoS attacks), and the ability to 
reallocate access lines from foreign to domestic 
customers. However, even though Hansabank's site 
remained online, XXXXXXXXXXXX estimated that it came
at a cost -  - at least 10 million Euros ($13.4 million)
 Hansabank  also had to temporarily block access to its site by all 
foreign ISPs so that there was enough broadband capacity 
for its domestic clients. However, Hansabank was able to 
create alternate access mechanisms for its largest 
foreign customers. Correcting much of the press coverage 
in the early days of the attacks, XXXXXXXXXXXX
 said that  while the cyber attacks against Hansabank and SEB were a 
challenge, there was no serious danger of Estonia's 
banking sector being shut down. 

<a href="http://213.251.145.96/cable/2007/06/07TALLINN366.html#par5" id="par5">¶</a>5. (S) This second wave of cyber attacks also hit the 
websites of Postimees, Estonia's paper of record, and 
Eesti Paevaleht, a leading Estonian-language daily, which 
over two-thirds of Estonians regularly visit for their 
news. "Imagine if you can the psychological effect," 
XXXXXXXXXXXX asked us, "when an Estonian tries to
pay his bills but can't or get the news online but can't." As 
one of the most wired countries on the planet, GOE 
interlocutors viewed the evolution of the attacks as a 
frightening threat to key economic and societal 
infrastructure. 

<a href="http://213.251.145.96/cable/2007/06/07TALLINN366.html#par6" id="par6">¶</a>6. (S) The attacks reached their apex on May 9, the 
Russian anniversary of the end of World War II. To cope 
with the rising volume of attacks, the GOE increased its 
broadband capacity from two Gbps (Gigabites per second) 
to eight Gbps. Hansabank, SEB, Postimees, and others 
also added servers to increase broadband capacity. A 
EUCOM cyber defense expert described it as a "cyber arms 
race" where the Estonians repeatedly increased their 
broadband capacity to match the increasing volume of 
cyber attacks (Ref D). XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that XXXXXXXXXXXX
increased the  "broadband pipe" for both government and private 
clients  at a frantic pace to keep up with the attacks.
XXXXXXXXXXXX  told us that one GOE ministry increased
its original  server capacity of 30 Mbps to 1 Gbps (1 Gbps
equals 1000  Mbps). XXXXXXXXXXXX said that this defensive
response by  the GOE and the private sector was ultimately
successful,  but it was extremely expensive. 

<a href="http://213.251.145.96/cable/2007/06/07TALLINN366.html#par7" id="par7">¶</a>7. (S) The number of attacks steadily declined after May 
9 and 10, allowing GOE and private sites to reduce their 
broadband capacity. However, on May 15, there was an 
unexpected spike in attacks that focused on Hansabank and 
SEB. In two separate and coordinated 15 minute attacks, 
these two sites were hit with over 400 bot attacks 
(roughly half the number of bot attacks recorded on May 
10) from multiple ISPs. The attacks temporarily crashed 
SEB's site for 30 minutes. Since the May 15 spike, the 
number of attacks has declined and is now hovering 
slightly above pre-April 27 numbers. 


No Smoking Gun 

TALLINN 00000366 003 OF 004 
<a href="http://213.251.145.96/cable/2007/06/07TALLINN366.html#par8" id="par8">¶</a>8. (S) On May 2, Foreign Minister Urmas Paet released a 
statement that the MFA had proof that some of the attacks 
originated from GOR ISPs. The Estonian and international 
press carried Paet's claim, but  XXXXXXXXXXXX interlocutors 
distanced themselves from the accusation. 
XXXXXXXXXXXX  privately said to us that no "smoking gun"
incriminating  Moscow has turned up and likely won't.
The use of bots,  proxies, and spoofing tactics makes it
extremely  difficult to determine with any certainty the origin 
of  the attacks. Press reports suggested that a million 
computers were involved in the attacks. However, 
XXXXXXXXXXXX admitted that due to Estonia's poor
monitoring  capability, XXXXXXXXXXXX could only speculate on the
number of computers and servers attacking Estonia, and had
even less specific information on the origins of the attacks. 
(Note. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that the one million figure
 used by  the press and the GOE was from a quote to the press
taken out of context in which he tried to explain how he could 
only speculate a number ranging from a 1000 to a million 
computers. End Note.) 

<a href="http://213.251.145.96/cable/2007/06/07TALLINN366.html#par9" id="par9">¶</a>9. (S) The GOE believes it has enough circumstantial 
evidence to link Moscow with the attacks. As President 
Ilves told the Ambassador, renting the large number of 
bots used in these attacks is an expensive business. 
Moreover, as XXXXXXXXXXXX repeatedly asked us in 
conversations, "Who benefits from these attacks?" He 
speculated that the probing nature of the attacks on 
specific government and strategic private sector targets 
through the use of anonymous proxies fit the modus 
operandi of the Putin regime testing a new "weapon." 
XXXXXXXXXXXXX told us that the GOE now feels that their original 
assessment of a "cyber riot" may have been incorrect. 
"Looking at the patterns of the attacks, it is clear that 
there was a small, core of individuals who intended to 
launch their attack on May 9," XXXXXXXXXXXX explained, "but 
when the MOD announced its plans to move the Bronze 
Soldier on April 27, they moved up their plans to try to 
link the attacks with the monument's removal." Estonian 
analysis of these later sophisticated attacks and 
organization through Russian-language internet forums has 
led them to believe that the key individuals tried to 
disguise their initial attacks as a cyber riot. "You 
don't expect spontaneous, populist cyber attacks to have 
a pre-determined list of targets and precise dates and 
times for coordinated attacks," said XXXXXXXXXXX. 

<a href="http://213.251.145.96/cable/2007/06/07TALLINN366.html#par10" id="par10">¶</a>10. (S) GOE interlocutors expressed their frustration 
that their requests for information from the GOR or 
action on Russian-based ISP attacks were not answered or 
acted upon. XXXXXXXXXXX complained that cooperation
with  Russia's CERT was almost nonexistent. Even at the height 
of the Bronze Soldier controversy, GOE interlocutors who 
regularly work with their Russian counterparts (e.g., law 
enforcement, customs and tax, border guards, etc.) tell 
us that working level cooperation was positive. In 
comparison, the lack of responsiveness by the GOR and 
Russian CERT personnel only diminished Russia's claims of 
innocence in the eyes of the Estonians. 

<a href="http://213.251.145.96/cable/2007/06/07TALLINN366.html#par11" id="par11">¶</a>11. (S) On May 29, Konstantin Koloskokov, Commissar of 
the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi in Transnistria, 
claimed responsibility for some of the early cyber 
attacks. While not discounting the possibility of his 
involvement, XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that some of the
attacks were  extremely sophisticated; beyond the technical
abilities  of an amateur. To illustrate the point, XXXXXXXXXXXX
 and  XXXXXXXXXXXX described an attack that used a mysterious
data  packet to crash a GOE and Elion router so quickly that 
the Estonians are still uncertain how it was done. 
XXXXXXXXXXXX described in detail a number of
additional  attacks using different tools and techniques
and targets  to argue that an organized group with deep
financial backing was the likeliest culprit. "Koloskokov is
window  dressing," said XXXXXXXXXXXX, "a convenient
set-up by the  real perpetrators."

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p><strong>vimpdb</strong> is a package that enables Python debugging through VIM.</p>
<p>Since rewritten and released in March 2010, it has been actively used, tuned and documented.</p>
<p>The <a class="external-link" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/vimpdb/0.4.1.2">0.4.1 release</a> focuses on usability right after installation. It brings two new features :</p>
<ul><li>an interactive wizard eases configuration : <strong>vimpdb</strong> asks for configuration values if the default values do not fit.<br /></li></ul>
<ul><li>when starting debugging, if no VIM server is running, <strong>vimpdb</strong> launches it.<br /></li></ul>
 
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>There is a <a class="external-link" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/vimpdb/0.4.2">0.4.2 release</a>.</p>
<p>This release removes the last main annoyance that avoided me to use <strong>vimpdb</strong> all the time : the lack of evaluation of arbitrary Python expression.</p>
<p>It actually adds two new commands :</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Plone collective is the free access (as in speech) SVN repository where the Plone community collaborates to build addons.</p>
<div class="pullquote">Commit access to the collective is given on request, without any conditions.</div>
<p>One of my contributions to the community is taking care of the commit access requests for the Collective. I process those requests since a few years and I wondered how many people where joining the Collective.</p>
<p>Begin of 2010, I started to actually count how many accesses I grant. Since January 2010, I counted around 80 accesses granted over around 40 weeks.</p>
<p>This accounts for 2 contributors a week or 100 a year.</p>
<p>Great to be part of a healthy community !</p></div>
