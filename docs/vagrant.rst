We use `Vagrant <https://vagrantup.com>`_ for testing and local development of our planet setup.

Dependencies
------------
- vagrant
- vagrant-hostsupdater [vagrant add-on]
- vagrant-cachier [vagrant add-on]

Please make sure that you have these add-ons installed !

.. todo:: More Info about the add-ons

For our convenience we created a Makefile, which will check for these add-ons and which can be used to start up vagrant
